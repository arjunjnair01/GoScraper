The brokerage firm highlights the bank’s robust management, consistent market share gains, and resilient underwriting through credit cycles.

    "title": "From assets to investments: Making infrastructure and real estate as investible as equities",
    "content": "For years, Indian investors focused mainly on Gold and Real Estate. In the last couple of decades, exposure to stocks and mutual funds has been increasing. There were limited opportunities to invest directly in infrastructure and Real Estate. But today, a new wave is changing the game for infrastructure and real estate just as accessible and investible as equities. This opportunity is not just financial innovation but a structural leap toward inclusive and sustainable investing, where every Indian investor from a young professional to a pension fund can participate in building the physical backbone of the country.The Rise of Real Assets as an Investible Class‘Investible’ means you can put your money into something and expect returns like buying shares of a company. Until recently, infrastructure like roads, power plants, transmission lines, warehouses and real estate like commercial buildings and malls were out of reach for most Indian investors due to large capital requirements and deep expertise required. However, global institutions and investors have been investing in Real Assets globally and in India over many decades.That changed with the advent of AIFs (Alternative Investment Funds), InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) and REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts). Now, these sectors are open to Indian investorAIFs, particularly those focused on infrastructure, real estate, and yield assets, offer investors the flexibility of participating in private-market opportunities not available through listed instruments.InvITs allow investors to earn income from operational infrastructure assets such as toll roads, annuity roads, transmission grids, renewable energy, warehousing, telecom towers, etc.REITs provide exposure to income-generating real estate like office spaces, malls, and industrial parks earning returns through rent and capital appreciation.All three are regulated, professionally managed, and yield-oriented, enabling investors to access stable, inflation-hedged returns once limited to large institutions.Why This Matters: From Physical to Financial AssetsThis movement represents India’s asset financialization, the conversion of physical, cash-generating assets into liquid investment opportunities.For investors, this delivers:Stable, predictable cash flows from long-term contracts, rents, and tariffs.Inflation-hedged, real returns, uncorrelated to short-term equity market volatility.Diversification across infrastructure, real estate, and private yield assets.Access and inclusivity, allowing retail and institutional investors alike to participate with modest investments.For the nation, this democratization channels domestic savings into productive, growth-driving assets funding India’s roads, power grids, renewable energy, logistics parks, and commercial infrastructure.Growth and Scale of InvIT \u0026 REITs Market Over the past few years, India has seen a remarkable rise in the popularity and scale of REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts). As of FY25, the combined Assets Under Management (AUM) of these instruments has reached USD 93.9 billion, more than doubling from USD 42.1 billion in FY20. This growth reflects increasing investor confidence and the maturity of these asset classes.InvITs alone account for a significant portion of this, with an AUM of USD 73 billion in FY25. Looking ahead, the InvIT market is projected to grow substantially, with estimates suggesting it could reach USD 258 billion by 2030. This signals a strong future for infrastructure investment through capital markets.Currently, India has 5 listed REITs and 26 listed InvITs, offering investors a range of options to participate in income-generating assets. Together, these trusts have a combined market capitalization of USD 33.2 billion, making them a substantial part of India’s financial ecosystem.AIFs: The Bridge Between Private and Public MarketsAIFs complement REITs and InvITs by offering customized structures that can fund early-stage projects, aggregate assets to developers, or acquire pre-operational assets before they mature into listed trusts.They play a crucial bridge role by channeling private capital into infrastructure and real estate well before those assets are ready for public-market. This ensures a continuous capital flow across the life cycle of real assets from creation to monetization.AIFs, too, have seen unprecedented growth with the total AUM crossing INR 10 lakh crore (USD 120 billion) reflecting a broad investor shift towards alternatives and yield-driven assets.As regulatory clarity deepens and performance histories lengthen, AIFs, InvITs, and REITs will collectively form a seamless ecosystem of real-asset investing, much like equities and mutual funds do today.Choosing the Right Platform: The Role of Asset ManagersWhile the opportunity is large, the quality of the platform managing these assets determines long-term success. Investors should evaluate onTrack record and governance of the asset managerTransparency and disclosure in operations and reportingTechnology adoption in monitoring and asset optimizationESG integration and sustainability performanceGrowth pipeline—visibility on future acquisitions that can expand the trust or fund’s AUMThe best managers today combine infrastructure operations expertise with institutional-grade risk management and transparency, ensuring investors participate not just in returns, but in responsible nation-building.India’s Next Leap: Financializing GrowthWith government infrastructure spending having risen from USD 12 billion in FY15 to USD 75 billion in FY25, the demand for capital will only multiply. Public resources alone cannot meet this scale.The next phase of India’s growth must therefore be capital-market led, where citizens, institutions, and global investors co-own India’s growth story through investible infrastructure and real estate assets.Every toll road, solar park, warehouse, and office tower is now a potential investment instrument, not just a physical structure. The convergence of AIFs, InvITs, and REITs is reshaping how wealth is created, risks are managed, and infrastructure is financed.This is not merely a shift in portfolio composition but a mindset transformation. The future of investing lies not in abstraction, but in ownership of the very assets that power India’s roads, cities, and industries.Infrastructure and real estate are no longer distant, illiquid domains, they are now as investible as equities. For investors and for India alike, that is the next great leap.(The author is CEO – EAAA Alternatives)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "content": "Ananth Narayan, who led a high-profile probe into Jane Street Group LLC as a senior official at India’s securities regulator, will hand over the investigation as his three-year term ends on Thursday.The former trader’s scheduled departure as a member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s board comes as the regulator faces the US proprietary trading firm in the nation’s appeal court. Narayan, the only person on SEBI’s board with a trading background, was thrust into the spotlight in July after signing an order that accused the US trading giant of manipulating India’s stock and derivatives markets — often at the expense of millions of retail investors.Narayan, who has spent more than two decades at global banks including Standard Chartered Plc, has been a driving force behind the charges against Jane Street, with a team comprising officers from the regulator’s surveillance and derivatives departments. SEBI is confident the team will see the probe through even after his departure, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.The case, one of the largest ever brought by SEBI against an overseas firm, has captured global attention. It pits the regulator of the world’s largest equity options market by contracts against one of Wall Street’s most profitable traders. The dispute also stoked fears that SEBI could further tighten rules, following curbs introduced late last year to damp retail speculation. The Indian government, which appoints members to SEBI, had sought applications for the post through Oct. 6, according to a notification issued last month on the website of the Department of Economic Affairs.In addition to market supervision, Narayan is also responsible for departments including enforcement and foreign portfolio investors, according to the regulator’s website.In its July order, the market regulator accused Jane Street of using its “immense trading, financial and technological prowess” to manipulate markets, particularly index options on expiry days. The findings mainly focused on trades in cash and derivatives involving Indian bank stocks and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.’s index tracking the sector. Jane Street has denied the allegations and pledged to fight them.The firm deposited 48.4 billion rupees ($545 million) in an escrow account to comply with the July ruling, which prompted the regulator to lift a temporary trading ban.Jane Street, which pulled in a record $10.1 billion in net trading revenue in the second quarter, has accused the regulator of withholding documents crucial to its defense and asked the court for a pause in legal proceedings till its appeal is heard.At a Sept. 9 hearing, Jane Street told the Securities Appellate Tribunal that it had not resumed trading in India since the July order. The tribunal is now set to hear the case on Nov. 18 and directed SEBI to defend itself through a written reply.",

    "title": "Explained: Reliance Industries is India’s most valuable company but why isn’t it No.1 in Nifty50 weight?",
    "content": "SynopsisReliance Industries, despite its massive market capitalization, ranks third in Nifty 50 index weight due to its lower free-float shares. Banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank hold higher weights because a larger portion of their stock is available for public trading, influencing the index more significantly.ETMarkets.comReliance Industries Ltd, India's largest company, holds third place in the Nifty 50 index.Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) may tower over India’s corporate landscape with the largest market capitalization on the bourses, but when it comes to the Nifty 50, the benchmark index that mirrors India’s stock market pulse, it plays second, or rather, third fiddle. As of September 30, RIL ranked third in index weight at 8.18%, behind HDFC Bank at 12.87% and ICICI Bank at 8.52%. The reason lies not in its valuation, but in what investors can actually trade.The free-float factorThe Nifty 50 doesn’t assign weight based on total market capitalization. Instead, it uses a free-float market capitalization method, which factors in only the shares available for trading by the public. Promoter holdings, government stakes, and other locked-in shares are excluded.RIL’s promoter group, led by the Ambani family, controls roughly half the company’s shares. That means only the remaining portion, the free float, contributes to its index weight.By contrast, both HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have public shareholding levels above 80%, giving them a far greater representation in the index calculation despite smaller total market caps. In the Nifty’s arithmetic, that translates to more weight, even if the total market value is smaller.This distinction is crucial. As the National Stock Exchange (NSE) explains, the Nifty 50 “is computed using a float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted methodology, wherein the level of the index reflects the float-adjusted market capitalization of all stocks.” The system, adopted in June 2009, ensures that the index reflects the market’s investable portion rather than sheer corporate scale.Why the math favours banksUnder this framework, HDFC Bank’s free-float advantage gives it the heftiest share of the Nifty at 12.87%, followed by ICICI Bank’s 8.52%. Reliance, despite being India’s most valuable company, comes in third at 8.18%.Infosys and Bharti Airtel round out the top five with weights of 4.6% and 4.53%, respectively.Sector-wise, financial services command the largest share of the index at 36.47%, followed by information technology at 9.91% and oil, gas and consumable fuels at 9.79%, the category where Reliance remains the dominant player.This composition means that banking stocks, with their large free floats and high liquidity, exert a stronger influence on the benchmark’s movements than capital-heavy groups with concentrated ownership structures.Also read | 15 stocks to shop for this Diwali; SBI Securities eyes up to 25% upside. Check listWhat it means for investorsFor investors, this weighting system has real implications. A stock’s weight determines how much its price moves sway the Nifty 50. So while Reliance’s size and influence over India Inc. are undeniable, its relatively lower free float keeps its impact on the index below that of HDFC Bank. A 1% swing in HDFC Bank, for instance, nudges the Nifty far more than a similar move in Reliance.In effect, a company with a smaller market cap but a higher free-float ratio can punch above its weight in index terms. The free-float adjustment makes the index more representative of the market’s investable portion and less skewed toward companies with large but tightly held valuations.On Wednesday, October 8, Reliance shares fell 1.3% to Rs 1,367.3, retreating after a 1.6% gain over the previous two sessions. Even so, RIL remains India’s most valuable company, just not the heaviest stock on the Nifty 50.Also read | Tata Steel shares are up 25% in 2025.

    "title": "TCS shares in focus ahead of Q2FY26 results today",
    "content": "Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services company, will be in sharp focus on Thursday, October 9, ahead of the company’s Q2FY26 results announcement later in the day.Brokerages have released a wide range of estimates for the quarter, projecting net profit growth between 3.7% and 9.6% year-on-year (YoY). Profit after tax (PAT) is expected to fall in the range of Rs 12,346 crore to Rs 13,058 crore, while revenue estimates span from Rs 64,200 crore to Rs 65,700 crore, reflecting a YoY increase of 0.7% to 2.2%.The brokerage consensus includes projections from Nomura, Nuvama Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Axis Securities, and HDFC Securities. Among these, Nuvama appears most optimistic, pegging TCS’s PAT at Rs 13,058 crore, up 9.6% YoY and 2.3% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).In contrast, HDFC Securities projects a more conservative PAT of Rs 12,346 crore, reflecting a 3.7% YoY rise but a 3.2% sequential decline. Axis Securities estimates PAT at Rs 12,874 crore, an increase of 7.7% YoY and 0.4% QoQ.Revenue estimates reflect a relatively stable performance, with Nomura expecting Rs 64,259 crore (up 1.4% YoY, 2.7% QoQ), Nuvama at Rs 64,738 crore (up 0.7% YoY, 2.1% QoQ), Motilal Oswal at Rs 65,400 crore (up 1.8% YoY, 3.1% QoQ), Axis Securities at Rs 65,682 crore (up 2.2% YoY, 3.5% QoQ), and HDFC Securities at Rs 65,045 crore (up 1.2% YoY, 2.5% QoQ).Nomura attributes its relatively muted growth projection to a lower BSNL contribution and macroeconomic headwinds, while Axis Securities highlights strength from the BFSI, Hi-Tech, and cross-currency tailwinds.On the EBIT front, estimates again vary, with Nuvama forecasting Rs 15,970 crore (up 3.3% YoY, 2.9% QoQ), Axis Securities estimating Rs 15,928 crore (up 3% YoY, 2.7% QoQ), and HDFC Securities projecting Rs 15,849 crore (up 2.5% YoY, 2.2% QoQ). EBIT margin projections indicate mixed expectations. Nomura anticipates a margin of 24.1% (up 40 bps YoY, flat QoQ), while Nuvama expects a slight improvement to 24.7% (up 60 bps YoY, 20 bps QoQ).Meanwhile, HDFC Securities forecasts a margin of 24.4% (up 30 bps YoY, down 9 bps QoQ), and Motilal Oswal expects a 20 bps QoQ decline, citing wage hikes, talent investments, and lower utilisation as key factors.Brokerages have also outlined key monitorables ahead of the earnings. Nomura will be closely tracking restructuring impacts, client discretionary spending amid U.S. macro volatility, cost takeout initiatives, BFSI vertical growth, and deal wins valued at $7–9 billion excluding mega deals. Nuvama is expected to watch employee restructuring developments.Motilal Oswal has flagged near-term demand, tech budgets, BFSI performance, GenAI transition, pricing trends, and delivery realignments as areas of focus. Axis Securities will be monitoring the H1-B visa impact along with BSNL advance purchase order updates.The broader industry environment has been marked by macroeconomic headwinds and pricing pressure, with clients remaining cautious on large or discretionary tech spending. While analysts expect TCS’s margins to remain stable on a YoY basis, some foresee a sequential decline.Also read: Tata Motors demerger effect: Shares slip 7% in 4 days.

    "title": "TCS to announce Q2 results today: 10 things to track and how to trade",
    "content": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reports its Q2 results today with investors bracing for tepid growth and razor-thin margin movements as the country's largest software exporter navigates headwinds from a planned 12,000-employee separation program, wage revisions, an uncertain US demand and H-1B visa issue.“We expect muted growth from TCS in Q2 as positive momentum in BFSI and tech will be largely offset due to weakness in life science \u0026 healthcare and communications. We are also building in a 10bps of CC (cross currency) headwind on revenues for the quarter,” HSBC’s Yogesh Aggarwal said.While the operating margins are likely to be marginally better sequentially, the positive impact of rupee depreciation is expected to be offset by wage hikes to junior employees. However, the benefit from restructuring may accrue gradually in the coming quarter.Here are 10 crucial factors analysts will scrutinize in TCS Q2 results:1) Impact of layoffsThe spotlight falls squarely on TCS's planned separation of 12,000 employees—roughly 2% of its workforce. Kotak Equities warns that investors will probe the rationale behind this move, its impact on employee morale, and associated costs. While most analysts haven't baked severance charges into their profit estimates, ICICI Securities expects a one-time hit in the September quarter.2) US demand and tariff impactWith President Trump's tariff policies creating uncertainty, the US market outlook becomes critical. Kotak questions \"whether impact on demand resulting from imposition of tariff by the US subsided,\" while HSBC and Nuvama flag US macro concerns as key monitorables. The developed markets have underperformed, raising questions about potential market share losses.Also Read | TCS or Infosys? Which IT company has the highest share of H-1B visa employees3) Revenue growth trajectoryAnalysts estimate flattish quarter-on-quarter constant currency growth. Systematix pegs growth at 1.3%, backed by deal ramp-ups but offset by the BSNL deal wind-down. \"Ramp-downs in a few accounts and weak demand environment will lead to moderate growth,\" Kotak notes.4) Margin performance under pressureEBIT margins face a delicate balancing act. While rupee depreciation provides tailwinds, September 1 wage hikes for junior staff—ranging 4.5-7% for 80% of the workforce—create headwinds. Estimates range from Elara's 20 basis points contraction to Nuvama's 20 bps expansion. ICICI Securities expects margins at 24.6%, up 10 bps, factoring workforce optimization savings.5) Mega deal and TCV pipelineTCS announced a mega deal during the quarter, including the EUR 550 million Tryg contract. Most analysts expect total contract value between $7-10 billion. \"Deal activity continues to remain healthy,\" says Antique Stock Broking, anticipating TCV around $10 billion despite cautious client spending.6) BFSI and key verticals outlookBanking, financial services and insurance remains the crucial vertical to watch. Equirus highlights the need for clarity on \"demand outlook in BFSI, retail, communication, hi-tech and other key segments.\" HSBC expects positive momentum in BFSI and tech, though offset by weakness in life sciences and communications.7) AI threat and pricing pressureThe generative AI transition signals a fundamental realignment in delivery models. Kotak flags concerns about \"pace of GenAI adoption and deflationary impact on spends,\" while Motilal warns that \"pricing pressure, client behavior, and the GenAI transition signal a start of realignment as vendors adapt pricing and delivery models.\"8) International markets performanceGeography mix becomes critical as analysts expect varied performance. Systematix notes that \"in the last quarter, growth was primarily driven by the UK, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe, and MEA markets, with the US and India markets recording muted growth.\" Equirus expects \"growth softness in Int'l markets.\"9) H-1B visa dependencyWork visa risks remain on the radar. Kotak specifically asks about \"H-1B dependence and plans for further derisking,\" while Axis Securities and Equirus list H1B visa impact among key monitorables. The issue gains urgency given the current US administration's immigration stance.10) GCC impact and client decision-makingGlobal capability centers continue disrupting traditional outsourcing. Kotak questions the \"impact of GCC ramp-up on growth of companies and GCC as a growth lever.\" Meanwhile, deal conversion cycles, client decision-making speed and pricing trends in AI-infused deals will signal whether spending patterns are normalizing.How to trade TCS shares amid resultsHistorical patterns suggest potential upside post-earnings, though derivative positioning remains cautious in TCS.\"Over the past decade, TCS has historically delivered an average return of 3.2% in the first week following its Q2 earnings announcement, with this pattern occurring 60% of the time,\" says Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. \"Additionally, 70% of the time, the stock has shown a 7% average return over the subsequent one-month period post-results.\"In the last one month TCS shares have remained flat while they are up 4% in the last one week. \"In 50% of the instances when TCS experienced negative returns in the one month leading up to its Q2 earnings, there was a 60% probability of a 5% average upside in the month following the announcement,\" James notes.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "content": "The Rs 1,377 crore IPO of Rubicon Research will open for subscription on October 9 and will close on October 13. The company, a specialty and generics-focused pharmaceutical manufacturer, is offering shares in the price band of Rs 461–485 per share, valuing it at around Rs 7,990 crore. The issue consists of a fresh issue of Rs 500 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 877 crore.Rubicon Research GMPAccording to market observers, Rubicon Research’s grey market premium (GMP) stood at Rs 90, or around 19% above the upper price band, indicating a firm listing expectation driven by investor interest in the healthcare sector.Brokerage reviewArihant Capital has recommended a \"Subscribe\" rating on the issue, citing strong growth momentum and a diversified product pipeline.\"Rubicon Research is an integrated pharmaceutical product development company with a strong presence in the US generics and specialty markets. Its leadership in the US generics space, combined with expansion into specialty pharmaceuticals through the Validus acquisition, positions it well for long-term growth,\" the brokerage said in its IPO note.The issue is fairly valued at a P/E of around 60 times FY25 earnings, but offers scalability and visibility in global markets.Company overviewRubicon operates across the US, Canada, and India, offering differentiated formulations across generics and specialty drugs. As of June 2025, the company had 72 approved products with the US FDA, 17 awaiting approval, and another 63 in development. It manages three manufacturing facilities in India and two R\u0026D centres — one in India and another in Canada.The company’s acquisition of Validus Pharmaceuticals in the US marks a strategic entry into branded specialty drugs, allowing direct access to prescribers across 44 states.FinancialsFinancially, Rubicon has seen a sharp turnaround. Revenue surged from Rs 4,190 crore in FY23 to Rs 12,962 crore in FY25, while net profit jumped to Rs 1,344 crore from a loss of Rs 169 crore two years earlier. EBITDA margins improved to 21% in FY25, up from 10% in FY23, indicating stronger operational leverage.Analysts believe the IPO could attract both institutional and retail investors looking for exposure to a fast-scaling mid-sized pharma exporter. With improving profitability, global reach, and strategic US expansion, the company appears well placed for long-term value creation.The issue will list on both the NSE and BSE, with Axis Capital as the lead manager and MUFG Intime India as the registrar.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "title": "Canara Robeco AMC IPO opens for subscription; GMP at 13%. Should you apply?",
    "content": "The Rs 1,326 crore IPO of Canara Robeco Asset Management Company will open for subscription on October 9 and will close on October 13. The issue, entirely an offer for sale, is priced between Rs 253 and Rs 266 per share, valuing the fund house at around Rs 5,300 crore.The IPO is one of the first by a public sector-backed mutual fund in recent years and is drawing attention for its growth consistency. The grey market premium (GMP) currently stands at 13%, suggesting moderate listing expectations.Should you subscribe?Analysts are largely optimistic about the long-term prospects, though near-term upside may be limited given sector headwinds.InCred Research, in its pre-IPO note, said the AMC’s retail-focused model and steady AUM expansion make it an attractive play among smaller asset managers.\"At the upper price band of Rs 266, we see higher rerating potential versus other PSU players, given its retail-focused approach,\" the brokerage said.While the IPO is seen as fairly valued, analysts view the offering as a steady, long-term investment rather than a quick listing play.Company overviewCanara Robeco AMC manages an average AUM of Rs 1.03 lakh crore as of FY25, maintaining a stable 1.5% market share. It has focused strongly on active equity schemes, which now form nearly 92% of its total AUM, including 80% in equity and 12% in hybrid funds.About 87% of its assets come from retail and HNI investors, providing a sticky and granular client base. The AMC also leverages Canara Bank’s nationwide branch network and Orix Corporation’s investment expertise, allowing it to balance growth and risk management.FinancialsFinancially, the AMC’s performance has been consistent. Net profit rose from Rs 790 crore in FY23 to Rs 1,907 crore in FY25, while revenue grew from Rs 2,046 crore to Rs 4,037 crore over the same period. Its return on equity (ROE) remains strong at 36.3%, comparable with leading private peers.The company’s equity-heavy portfolio supports higher yield but limits participation in fast-growing passive and ETF categories, analysts noted.Post listing, Canara Bank’s stake in the AMC will fall from 51% to 38%, and the lender will need to trim it further to 30% by FY30 in line with RBI norms.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The QIB category led the issue with 3.42 times, followed by NIIs at 1.98 times and retail investors at 1.10 times.Tata Capital IPO GMPDespite the Tata brand backing, analysts said the grey market premium (GMP) has moderated to around 1%, suggesting limited listing gains. The stock is currently commanding a GMP of Rs 3.5, indicating a potential listing in the range of Rs 330 per share against the issue price of Rs 326.Market experts believe the muted GMP reflects fair valuation rather than lack of investor interest. \"The IPO was priced optimally for long-term investors. Tata Capital’s diversified lending base, prudent risk management, and digital lending push offer steady growth potential,\" analysts said.Tata Capital is the third-largest diversified NBFC in India, offering retail, corporate, and wealth management services.As of June 2025, it operates 1,516 branches across 27 states and union territories, with a growing digital footprint. The company reported a 56% jump in revenue and 10% rise in profit in FY25, with consolidated net profit at Rs 3,655 crore and return on equity (ROE) of 12.6%.Listing outlookWith its clean balance sheet, strong parentage, and broad-based lending model, Tata Capital’s listing is expected to be steady rather than spectacular, mirroring the company’s conservative yet enduring ethos.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

In response, India made plain the deals are price-driven and would continue, although it’s also signalled it wants to buy more US energy amid talks with Washington.Indian refiners are expected to boost oil imports from Russia in the coming months, as trade talks with Washington drag on and discounts widen amid ample supplies.\n\nDiscounts on Urals crude loading in November are $2-to-$2.50 a barrel to Dated Brent, making it attractive, according to people familiar with the developments. That’s cheaper than discounts of about $1 a barrel in July-to-August, when supplies were tight due to Moscow’s prioritising local customers.\n\nFor the current month, ship-tracking data point to an uptick in arrivals. Crude imports from Russia could average about 1.7 million barrels a day in October, according to Kpler Ltd. That would be about 6% higher on-month, but slightly lower than last year’s pace.\nThe US imposed a punitive 50% levy on US imports of Indian goods in August in a bid to pressure New Delhi to curb its appetite for Russian oil, although it’s refrained from similar action against China, another major buyer. In response, India made plain the deals are price-driven and would continue, although it’s also signalled it wants to buy more US energy amid talks with Washington.\n\nStill, at this stage, it remains unclear whether Indian refiners will continue to maximise purchases of discounted Russian crude given the talks with the US, said the people. Last month, officials from New Delhi described meetings as “constructive”, even with Washington’s demand that India stop buying Russian oil.\n\nMeanwhile, India’s state processors have begun talks with national oil companies in the Middle East and Africa for term deals for 2026, the people said. Refiners would be seeking greater volumes from suppliers able to provide flexibility around volumes, such as allowing buyers to resell or optimise cargoes should Russian imports become more viable, they added.\n\nSpokespeople for Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. didn’t reply to an email seeking comments.\n\nRead Also: Garuda Construction and Engineering secures ₹144 crore redevelopment order in Mumbai",

It is also seeking increased funding to support a regular training program for its staff, they said.\n\nThe demand for autonomy underscores the regulator’s assessment that it needs to muscle up and bolster oversight of the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market. Any capacity constraints at the DGCA also risk raising concerns about its ability to ensure safety — a worry amplified after the recent Air India crash that killed all but one passenger and triggered a system-wide audit.\nCurrently, the Indian regulator operates with limited manpower resources and funding that’s a fraction of what its global peers receive.\n\nAs of July, the DGCA had filled only 553 of 1,063 technical posts and employed 4,295 air traffic controllers, the people said. In contrast, the US Federal Aviation Administration has 46,170 employees, including 14,000 controllers and 7,000 safety inspectors.\n\nFor the year ending March 31, the DGCA has been allocated just $38 million, compared to the FAA’s $23.1 billion in fiscal 2024, they added. European Union Aviation Safety Agency, or EASA’s 2024 allocation was eightfold of its Indian counterpart’s while the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority got nearly six times in 2023 of DGCA’s current allocation, the people said.\nThe DGCA and India’s Aviation Ministry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments.\n\nUnlike the DGCA, which operates under India’s Civil Aviation Ministry, the CAA and EASA are independent bodies, the people said. The FAA, under the US Department of Transportation, enjoys relatively limited autonomy, they said.\n\nIndia’s aviation sector has grown consistently over the past decade, with passenger numbers more than doubling to 234 million from 116 million and aircraft fleet size growing over 100% to 841.\n\nRising Workload\n\nIndian carriers have ordered more than 1,300 planes — one of the largest order books from any country — signalling that the regulator’s workload is only going to increase in the coming years.\n\nThe Indian aviation regulator also lacks a formal training module, and funding constraints have hindered efforts to develop specialised programs in collaboration with domestic and international institutions.\n\nThis has led to challenges in deploying qualified inspectors across the country, particularly for certain aircraft types located in regions without trained personnel, the people said.\n\nRead Also: India's apex cotton body says prices at 4-year-low, industry's survival vital to sustain cultivation",

Manufacturers are also required to maintain detailed records of such tests as per Schedule U of the Rules.\n\nDr Raghuvanshi has urged all State and UT Drug Controllers to take immediate measures to ensure compliance, including intensified inspections, monitoring of testing procedures, and sensitising pharmaceutical manufacturers through official circulars. He has also emphasised that companies must have a robust vendor qualification system in place and source raw materials only from reliable, approved vendors.\n\nThe communication reflects heightened regulatory vigilance after multiple incidents of contamination in cough syrups have been linked to adverse health outcomes, both in India and abroad.\n\nThe CDSCO’s latest move seeks to plug systemic gaps in pharmaceutical quality control and ensure public health safety by tightening oversight of testing protocols across the supply chain.\n\nAccording to the communication, state drug authorities have been directed to take strict action and report back on such actions taken in response.(Edited by : Ajay Vaishnav)",

    "content": "Delhi air pollution crisis presents a collection of surprising and alarming facts that highlight its severe impact on the health of residents, the city's infrastructure, and the economy. Here is a list of five facts about Delhi's air quality that may surprise you.As winter arrives in India, generally around the time of the biggest celebration, Diwali, the air in Delhi thickens and turns brown, including visible pollutants. The air quality in the national capital deteriorates annually due to several factors, which include crop stubble burning, vehicular emissions, and industrial smoke.\n\nThe air pollution crisis presents a collection of surprising and alarming facts that highlight its severe impact on the health of residents, the city's infrastructure, and the economy. Here is a list of five facts about Delhi's air quality that may surprise you.\n\n1. The Red Fort is losing its red colour and turning black: The iconic 17th-century Red Fort's signature red sandstone is gradually turning black, and the culprit is the city’s worsening air pollution. According to a joint study by Indian and Italian researchers published in the Heritage journal, researchers found black crusts of pollutants building up on the monument's walls.\n\n2. Two lakh residents reported air pollution hospitalisations between 2022-24: Over 2 lakh Delhi residents were hospitalised for respiratory issues linked to air pollution between 2022 and 2024, according to a report citing data from six central hospitals. In 2024 alone, over 68,000 cases of Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) were reported in Delhi.\n\n3. Air pollution has resulted in lung damage for millions of children: The poor air quality in the city has caused irreversible lung damage to about 2.2 million children. This prolonged exposure can also lead to chronic respiratory conditions like asthma and increase the risk of heart and neurological diseases later in life.\n\n4. It is ageing residents faster: The Delhi pollution is accelerating the physical ageing process. The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that chokes residents' lungs also penetrates deep into the skin layers, resulting in inflammation, oxidative stress and the breakdown of collagen.\n\n“Air pollution carries tiny particles called particulate matter (PM). This would penetrate deep skin layers and cause inflammation, giving dark spots and a dull look. Exposure over time to air pollution is likely to compromise the natural barrier that the skin possesses, thereby becoming dehydrated and irritated and, thus, making visible signs of ageing,” Dr Ruben Bhasin Passi, Consultant - Dermatology, CK Birla Hospital Gurugram, said, according to a 2024 report in Times Now.\n\n5. Microplastics in the air: A recent report revealed that microplastics—tiny plastic particles invisible to the naked eye—are present in Delhi's air year-round. It found that Delhi adults inhale nearly twice as many microplastic particles in summer (21.1 daily) as in winter (10.7 daily), highlighting a 97% jump. Adults in Delhi may inhale between 1,935 and 5,621 microplastic particles annually.\n\nAlso Read: Delhi to move Supreme Court to allow certified green firecrackers on Diwali(Edited by : Priyanka Deshpande)",

These guidelines, however, do not take into account an irreparable mental trauma, agony, upheaval and derangement of the victims and their family members, the collective conscience of the nation and the deterrent effect which the capital punishment intends to make.\"",

That's Nandan Nilekani's vision for a 'finternet'—a tokenized, AI-driven world where assets like gold and real estate become more easily transactable.The man who built Aadhaar now wants to build an internet for finance (finternet) that makes trading traditionally illiquid assets far easier than it is today.\n\"We'll be live in 2026,\" Nilekani announced at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai. The goal, he said, is to unlock the \"trillions of dollars\" Indians have parked in gold and real estate and put that wealth to work.\nNilekani aims to take his next big project beyond India to Singapore, New York, San Francisco, and Switzerland.\n\"We think tokenisation and AI will catalyse that change,\" he said. \nWhat is tokenisation?\nWhen an asset is tokenised, each token then represents a piece or the whole of that asset which can then be bought, sold, or traded digitally. For instance, a building worth ₹10 crore can be tokenised into 1,000 tokens.\nA person can buy fractions of that property, say two tokens of it worth  ₹1 lakh each which makes transferring ownership easy. The same logic applies for gold or any other asset class.\n\"Tokenisation is nothing but allowing an asset to travel with all its attributes,\" Nilekani explained.\n\"What we're suggesting is using tokenisation inside a regulatory framework, embedded compliance, but unlocking the potential of tokenised assets,\" he added.\nHow does the 'finternet' work\nDemonstrations at the annual fest show that the finternet features an AI chatbot that helps the user navigate investments and trade assets to gain ownership of real estate properties.\nThe user should first sign up and get a \"finternet address\" to store identities, credentials, or any type of asset. Those who already have their identity documents on DigiLocker can import them directly, build an online profile, and link it to their bank, investment, and tax accounts.\n\"Real estate builders will tokenise the product that they are building. Once done, they can request third-party auditors, testers to verify all the provenance behind that and submit proofs,\" a team member of finternet presented.\nThe platform's Approved Project Financing (APF) does due diligence for both the real estate builder or property owner as well as for the borrower or buyer.\n'Financial inclusion to ignition'\nBesides finternet, Nandan Nilekani highlighted more areas of growth despite India succeeding at digital identities, payments, and e-signing which he said was another \"silent success\".\n\"Go beyond inclusion to allow people to meet their aspirations and empower them even further. There are many things to it. While we have done a great job on ID in individuals, we have to do better on ID for businesses,\" he said.\n\"We need a single business ID around which we can do things,\" he added.\nNilekani also highlighted the need to make cross-border financial services better, especially as India is the largest receiver of inward remittances in the world.",

In 2020, residents of a village witnessed a stunning view of Mount Everest from their house.\n\nMeteorologists attribute the rare visibility to a haze-free atmosphere, which is often a result of heavy rainfall clearing particulate matter and dust from the air. This allows for unobstructed views of distant peaks, even those hundreds of kilometres away. The clear skies and reduced pollution levels created perfect conditions for the Himalayan range to be seen in all its glory.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)First Published: Oct 8, 2025 7:03 PM IST",

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) approved the withdrawal and accepted the consent terms on Wednesday, as reported by Live Law.\n\nThe issue focuses on a trade-licence agreement that Jerai Fitness signed in October 2018 that granted them the authority to produce and sell workout equipment using Salman Khan's trademark, ‘BEING STRONG.’\n\nAccording to the actor, Jerai failed to pay royalties, although the new conditions were agreed upon because of the COVID-19 pandemic's disruptions. Salman's legal team submitted a demand notice in September 2024, requesting ₹7.24 crore plus interest at a rate of 24% annually.\n\nSalman previously filed a default claim with the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) Mumbai bench. The NCLT, however, rejected his appeal in May 2025, noting that only ₹1.63 crore was uncontested and that the remaining amount contained significant pre-existing contractual disputes over product lines, rights, and authorisations.\n\nUnresolved issues included marketing, distribution, and prior approvals, as well as Jerai's investment in new product lines (like the ‘X-tend’ and ‘Proton’ series), according to Livemint.\n\nAccording to NCLT, Jerai Fitness was not allowed to distribute any goods using the name that were not expressly pre-approved. The tribunal went on to state that the claim was “in the domain of recovery proceedings” rather than resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).\n\nDissatisfied with the NCLT's decision, Salman filed an appeal with NCLAT, and the matter was heard on October 6, which was later postponed. NCLAT has disposed of the appeal, and the settlement is now recorded, thus ending the two parties' insolvency litigation.\n\nChairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan and Technical Member Arun Baroka made up the bench that took the consent.\n\nSalman Khan was represented by attorneys Parag Khandhar, Varun Kalra, Tapan Radkar, and Shaham Ulla on the legal teams under the direction of DSK Legal.

(PTI Photo))A BJP leader from Tamil Nadu has moved the Supreme Court, seeking a CBI probe into the September 27 stampede at Karur during a political rally of actor and TVK founder Vijay that killed 41 people and injured more than 60.\n\nThe plea, filed by GS Mani, an apex court lawyer and the vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) state legal cell, has also sought a stay on the Tamil Nadu Police's probe into the Karur incident.\n\nThe top court has already listed other related pleas for a hearing on October 10.\n\nIn his plea filed through Advocate-on-Record R Sathish, Mani has urged the court to transfer the probe from the Tamil Nadu Police to either the CBI or an independent Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by a current or former Supreme Court judge.\n\n\"The petitioner who is a public-spirited citizen and also a regular practising advocate of this court... has filed this SLP against the impugned common final judgment... dated October 3... in a batch of writ petitions including... filed by him, seeking transfer of investigation from the respondent state's local police to the CBI and payment of adequate compensation in relation to a stampede incident at a political meeting in Karur District, Tamil Nadu,\" the plea says.\n\nRead more: CJI Gavai attack: Supreme Court lawyer seeks contempt proceedings against Rakesh Kishore\n\nIt says the high court had held that sweeping allegations, without tangible material, cannot justify transferring the investigation to a central agency.\n\n\"The (high) court also declined to direct enhanced compensation, noting that the state government had announced compensation of ₹10 lakh to each victim's family, while the political party had announced ₹20 lakh. The incident is not only a case of criminal negligence but also a gross violation of Article 21 of the Constitution,\" the plea says.\n\nA free, fair and impartial investigation is part of the fundamental right to life and liberty not only of the victims but also of every citizen, it says.\n\n\"Where the state machinery itself is under suspicion, investigation must be entrusted to an independent agency like the CBI, or a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by a retired/sitting judge of the Supreme Court,\" the plea says.\n\nThe petitioner has also sought enhanced compensation for the victims, urging the court to direct the state government and TVK to pay higher ex-gratia amounts.\n\nThe plea has demanded a compensation of ₹50 lakh per deceased from the state government and ₹1 crore each from the actor and his political party.\n\nSo far, the Tamil Nadu government has provided a compensation of ₹10 lakh per deceased, while Vijay has contributed ₹20 lakh each from his personal funds.\n\nOn October 3, the high court formed an SIT to probe the stampede.\n\nRead more: Here are all the states that have banned cough syrups for children below 2 years\n\nThe principal bench of the high court also dismissed a BJP leader's plea seeking a CBI probe into the incident and directed her to approach the Madurai bench.\n\nThe high court formed the SIT under senior IPS officer and Inspector General, North Zone, Asra Garg. It also criticised the organisers of the event, the TVK leadership and police over the stampede, which killed multiple women and children, among others.\n\nA total of 41 people died in the stampede, with police noting that the rally saw a turnout of 27,000, nearly three times the expected figure of 10,000.\n\nPolice also blamed a seven-hour delay on Vijay's part in reaching the venue for the tragedy.",

    "content": "HomeTravel NewsRelief for train travellers: You will soon be able to reschedule tickets without any extra chargeIn case passengers plan to reschedule tickets, getting confirmed tickets for another date will depend on seat availability. \"There’s no guarantee of getting a confirmed ticket for the new date,\" said Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.Train travel can at times become a burden rather than a boon, especially when you need to reschedule your travel date. For instance, if you plan to travel on October 15 and for some unavoidable reason, you need to postpone your journey to another date, the procedure at present requires the traveller to cancel the existing ticket an rebook for another date, depending on how close to the travel time you cancel the ticket.\n\nSo, in the current cancellation framework, passengers who cancel their confirmed tickets between 48 and 12 hours prior to departure lose 25% of the fare. This percentage increases further for cancellations made closer to departure, and once the reservation chart is prepared, refunds are not permitted, thus the traveller losing a significant amount.\n\nCome January, passengers will be allowed to reschedule confirmed railway tickets without paying any extra cost. Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently said that a new provision will be introduced in January 2026 that seeks to alleviate the stress and financial loss associated with last-minute travel plan changes. Rather than cancelling tickets, passengers will have the option to change their travel date online, without facing penalties.\n\nAlso read | Vande Bharat sleeper trains to launch once second rake arrives post October 15: Railway minister\n\nHowever, Vaishnaw clarified that rescheduling tickets and getting confirmed tickets for another date will depend on seat availability. \"There’s no guarantee of getting a confirmed ticket for the new date,\" he said, according to reports. If the new ticket is priced higher than the original, the passenger will be required to pay the difference in fare.\n\nThe move is expected to benefit millions of passengers across the country who currently face limited flexibility and financial loss when they need to unexpectedly alter travel dates.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved four major multi-tracking railway projects across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Chhattisgarh. The projects, with an estimated investment of ₹24,634 crore, aim to boost capacity and improve connectivity across 18 districts.\n\nA Railway official was quoted as saying by PTI that the projects will expand Indian Railways' existing network by approximately 894 km, enabling smoother movement of people, goods, and services. The approved works includes the laying of a third and fourth line between Wardha and Bhusawal, spanning 314 km in Maharashtra, an 84 km fourth line between Gondia and Dongargarh, covering Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and a 259 km third and fourth line between Vadodara and Ratlam in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAlso read | Vande Bharat trains will not run on this route, confirms Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw\n\n\"The approved multi-tracking project will enhance connectivity to approximately 3,633 villages, which have a population of about 85.84 lakh and two Aspirational Districts (Vidisha and Rajnandgaon),” a statement from the Railways Ministry said.\n\nVaishnaw, added that the expansion of line capacity would boost mobility and improve the operational efficiency and reliability of railway services. \"The projects are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji’s vision of a New India which will make the people of the region 'Aatmanirbhar' by way of comprehensive development in the area that will enhance their employment/self-employment opportunities,\" PTI quoted him as saying.(Edited by : Jerome Anthony)First Published: Oct 8, 2025 2:44 PM IST",

The controversy erupted following the discovery of significant discrepancies in the weight of gold-plated copper panels that were sent for repairs. The developments in the matter include a judicial probe, the suspension of a temple official, and ongoing political protests.\n\nUproar in Kerala assembly for third day\n\nOn Wednesday, the Kerala Legislative Assembly was rocked by opposition parties protesting the Sabarimala gold plating controversy for the third day in a row. Shortly after the day's proceedings began, opposition MLAs stormed the assembly well, chanting slogans and brandishing placards demanding the resignation of Devaswom Minister V N Vasavan and the dissolution of the Travancore Devaswom Boards (TDB).\n\nDemanding the resignation of Kerala Devaswom minister, Leader of the Opposition VD Satheeshan said, “For the past two days, the opposition has not cooperated with the Assembly proceedings. We will continue to withhold cooperation in legislative proceedings until the Devaswom Minister resigns.”\n\nNo offender will be allowed to escape..., says Kerala CM\n\nChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared on Wednesday that the Kerala government would not spare any wrongdoers, take action without favour, or let anyone involved in the Sabarimala gold plating incident get away with it.\n\n“In the Sabarimala gold plating controversy, the government announced an investigation right from the beginning. We will never protect any wrongdoers. The government's stance is to take action without favour, regardless of who is at fault. A special investigation team was appointed in this matter,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.\nThe Chief Minister added that the government has been investigating the matter since the beginning, and that following the High Court ruling, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been constituted for the case, overseen by the Additional Director General of Police (ADGP).\n\nSabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajam calls for CBI probe\n\nThe Sabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajam (SASS) has asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the alleged gold theft.\n\nSASS National Chairman SJR Kumar stated in a letter to the Kerala Additional Chief Secretary (Home) that an investigation conducted by the Devaswom Vigilance or the Kerala State Police cannot be expected to reveal the full truth because there is a serious possibility of interference or manipulation by the parties involved.\n\n“Only a neutral and central agency like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) can ensure a fair, transparent, and credible inquiry. I, National Chairman of Sabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajam and a devotee of Lord Ayyappa, wish to bring to your urgent attention serious revelations regarding the theft and substitution of gold claddings from the Sabarimala Temple, carried out under the guise of gold plating and repair,” Kumar said.\n\nTravancore Devaswom Board suspends officer over 'false' report\n\nThe Travancore Devaswom Board on Tuesday suspended B Murari Babu, Deputy Devaswom Commissioner for Haripad, in connection with the alleged irregularities. The senior official was suspended for allegedly submitting a misleading report about the Sabarimala gold plating of the temple's 'Dwarapalaka' idols.\n\nAs per the board, the incident occurred on June 17, 2019, while Murari Babu was the administrative officer at the temple.\n\nHe apparently submitted a report to the Sabarimala Executive Officer that falsely represented the gold-plated Dwarapalaka idols on either side of the sanctum sanctorum (Sreekovil) as copper sheets. Terming it a serious administrative lapse, the board has placed Murari Babu under suspension pending a detailed inquiry.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "HomeTechnology NewsTinder in India now checks video selfies to block fake profilesTinder has rolled out Face Check in India, a new feature that uses video selfies to verify users, reduce fake profiles to enhance safety for those seeking connections on the app.Online dating app Tinder, on Wednesday, introduced a new feature in India called Face Check to help users avoid fake profiles and make the app safer. The tool requires new users to record a short video selfie. This selfie is then compared to the photos they have on their profile.\n\nIf the pictures match, the user receives a Photo Verified badge, which signals to others that the person is real and not a bot or someone using fake photos.\n\nTinder says Face Check is part of its ongoing efforts to limit scams, bots, and impersonation on the platform. The company has previously introduced several safety tools for Indian users, such as:\n \tID Verification – Users can verify their identity by submitting official identification documents.\n \tWarnings – Alerts that notify users if someone is sending suspicious or harmful messages.\n \tAre You Sure – A feature that asks users to reconsider before sending messages that might be offensive.\n \tDoes This Bother You – Allows users to report behaviour they find uncomfortable or inappropriate.\n \tReporting enhancements – Improvements to how users can report suspicious or unsafe accounts.\n\nAccording to Tinder’s Modern Dating Report, many young Indian users value authenticity and safety. More than one in three consider profile verification an important factor when choosing potential matches.\n\nUsers also take other precautions, such as meeting in public places (50%), sharing plans with friends or family (42%), avoiding sharing personal information (40%), and video calling before meeting someone in person (37%).",

While spending on vegetables, fruits, and processed foods has gone up, which the new inflation basket will reflect.India’s upcoming base year revisions for GDP, CPI and IIP will significantly expand the base and coverage of sectors, particularly if the government gets access to more granular data, MoSPI Secretary Saurabh Garg said in an interaction with CNBC-TV18.\n\nGarg said the national accounts and GDP series will draw from new and alternate data sources, including GST data, digital platforms such as e-VAHAN, and payments data.\n\n“The new series will capture a much larger part of the digital economy. GDP coverage will increase as we incorporate more real-time and electronic data,” he explained.\n\nGarg added that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will also see a substantial overhaul. The CPI basket size will rise from 299 to over 350 items, “at least”, with e-commerce to be included for the first time.\n\n“A lot of digital products will move into the CPI basket, capturing products and sources of data, like where the households are purchasing - the revision will increase the number of markets, products and types of markets from where you are getting the data,\" Garg said.\n\nWith the proportion of food items in the CPI having come down as per the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey, the weightage of food, particularly cereals, in the new CPI is also expected to decline. While spending on vegetables, fruits, and processed foods has gone up, which the new inflation basket will reflect.\n\nThe Index of Industrial Production (IIP) will similarly undergo expansion, with more sectors being added to better capture industrial activity.\n“In all three revisions — national accounts, CPI, and IIP — the coverage will deepen and granularity will increase, as more data sources are brought in. This will help us build a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the economy,” the MoSPI Secretary said.\n\nAccording to Garg, the new data series will roll out in early 2026.\n\n• The new CPI series with 2024 as the base year for January will be released on February 12, 2026.\n\n• The revised GDP series with 2022–23 as the base year will be released by the end of February 2026, meaning the Second Advance Estimates of FY26 GDP will be on the new base year.\n\n• The new IIP series, based on April 2026 data, will be released in May 2026.\n\nFor CPI and IIP, the government is not considering any changes to the release timelines.\n\n“All the base year revisions are on track. By early 2026, the economy’s key indicators—GDP, CPI, and IIP—will all reflect these changes,” Garg affirmed.\n\nThe MoSPI (Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation) will start stakeholder consultations on the new methodologies for each of the data sets by the end of this month or early November, initially in Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nRead Also: Ixigo-parent shares in focus after unnamed investor intends to buy up to 16% stakeFirst Published: Oct 8, 2025 8:31 AM IST",

    "content": "Five smart gadgets that will help you breathe cleaner air at homeFrom air purifiers to smart sensors, these five gadgets will help you create a cleaner, healthier indoor environment for your home. Read on:1 / 7With rising levels of indoor and outdoor pollution, ensuring clean air inside homes has become increasingly important. From dust and allergens to mould spores and harmful gases, indoor air can often contain hidden pollutants that affect health and comfort. A range of innovative devices now make it easier to monitor and improve indoor air quality. Take a look at five smart gadgets that can help you breathe easier at home. (PTI Photo)2 / 71. Air Purifiers are widely recognised as one of the most effective tools for improving indoor air quality. Equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, they trap airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns, including pollen, pet dander, dust, and some bacteria. These devices are especially beneficial for households with pets or people suffering from allergies. Some advanced models also combine HEPA filtration with UV-C light technology, providing an additional layer of protection by neutralising microorganisms. (Photo: Shutterstock)3 / 72. Smart Air Quality Monitors help in understanding what all substances are there in the air. They track levels of pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PM 2.5 particles, and humidity. These compact sensors display real-time data on mobile apps, enabling homeowners to adjust ventilation or activate purifiers as needed. (Image: Rob Schultz_IDG)4 / 73. Humidifiers: Dry indoor air can lead to respiratory discomfort and skin irritation, especially in colder months. Smart humidifiers maintain optimal moisture levels between 40% and 60%, helping prevent dryness while supporting better respiratory health. Some models also clean water before releasing mist and allow the addition of essential oils for a fresher environment. (Image: Wikipedia)5 / 74. UV Air Treatment Systems, often integrated into HVAC units, these gadgets use ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, viruses, and mould spores as air circulates. This creates an additional barrier against airborne pathogens, reducing the spread of illnesses. Such systems are particularly useful during flu season or in homes with vulnerable individuals. (Representative Image from Wikipedia)6 / 75. Smart Thermostats: Modern smart thermostats offer air quality monitoring features in addition to temperature control. They can detect when indoor air becomes polluted and automatically trigger ventilation systems to refresh the air. Real-time data is accessible via mobile apps, enabling users to maintain healthy indoor conditions with minimal effort. (Image: Wikipedia)7 / 7Investing in a combination of these devices can significantly enhance indoor air quality. Whether through filtration, monitoring, humidity control, or germicidal technology, these smart gadgets are making homes healthier and more comfortable because breathing clean air keeps you healthy.

    "content": "HomeIndia NewsHealthcare NewsDrug Controller recommends Sresan Pharma's licence cancellation after high DEG levels found in cough syrupsThe deaths of children due to consumption of these contaminated cough syrups have reignited concerns about quality control lapses in India’s pharmaceutical supply chain. Read on:In the wake of the tragic deaths of several children suspected to be linked to the consumption of contaminated cough syrup, the central and state drug regulators have swung into action.\n\nSources told CNBC-TV18 that a series of tests conducted over the past few days have confirmed the presence of diethylene glycol (DEG)—a toxic industrial solvent—in certain cough syrup samples, leading the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to recommend the cancellation of Sresan Pharma’s manufacturing licence.\n\nAccording to sources, 19 samples have been tested so far by the CDSCO, Madhya Pradesh Food and Drugs Administration (MP FDA), and Tamil Nadu Food and Drugs Administration (TN FDA), as authorities attempt to trace the source of the contamination that has raised nationwide alarm.\n\nThe first set of test results, sources said, came on October 3, when six samples tested by CDSCO and three by MP FDA were found to be free of DEG and ethylene glycol (EG). However, the situation changed dramatically later that night when the TN FDA submitted test results of Coldrif syrup, manufactured by Sresan Pharma, which revealed 48% DEG—a level hundreds of times above the permissible limit of 0.1%.\n\nThe following day, on October 4, more samples of Coldrif collected from retail outlets and pharmacies in Madhya Pradesh were tested, again confirming the presence of 46% DEG, sources said. By the end of the day, 10 samples had been tested, several of which confirmed the same pattern of contamination in syrups produced by Sresan Pharma.\n\nRead more: Cough syrup linked deaths: PIL seeks Supreme Court intervention as toll rises, MP bans 2 more drugs\n\nSources further said that on October 5 and 6, additional test reports from the MP FDA revealed that two other products—Refile Syrup and Respifresh TR Syrup—also contained DEG, though at relatively lower levels. Refile Syrup showed 0.616% DEG and Respifresh TR Syrup showed 1.342% DEG, but these were still above the permissible limit.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, sources told CNBC-TV18 that the DCGI has written to the Tamil Nadu FDA, urging immediate cancellation of Sresan Pharma’s licence. Officials have also been asked to step up vigilance and conduct a wider probe to identify other manufacturers possibly flouting drug safety norms.\n\nThe deaths have reignited concerns about quality control lapses in India’s pharmaceutical supply chain, especially after previous global incidents involving DEG contamination in cough syrups exported from India. Regulatory authorities are now under growing pressure to ensure strict enforcement of manufacturing standards and prevent further tragedies.\n\nFurther action from both central and state agencies is awaited as investigations continue into how the contamination occurred and whether lapses in testing or oversight contributed to the crisis.\n\nRead more: Explained: What is DEG, the industrial toxin being linked to child deaths from cough syrup in MP and Rajasthan",

    "content": "HomeBusiness NewsAviation NewsHow to reach Navi Mumbai International Airport: Routes, travel time \u0026 connectivity explainedNavi Mumbai International Airport is set to begin operations by mid-December. Here’s a guide on routes, travel times, and connectivity from key city locations ahead of its launch.\n\nThe Navi Mumbai International Airport will be inaugurated on October 8, with commercial operations expected to start by mid-December 2025. Before flights begin, the terminal approach area must be completed, followed by security clearance checks by the CISF—a process that will take roughly 45 days. The Airports Authority of India will then give its final approval.\n\nInitially, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) will operate flights from 8 AM to 8 PM, meaning only daytime operations will begin. Since international flights typically operate at night, these will be introduced later. \nThe first flights will be operated by Air India, IndiGo, and Akasa Air, while international airlines will be added in a subsequent phase once night operations are cleared.\n\nThe airport will start with one runway and one terminal, handling 10–12 air traffic movements per hour and up to 20 million passengers annually. The second terminal is expected to be ready by 2029, adding capacity for 30 million passengers, with a total of four terminals planned to handle 90–100 million passengers yearly.How to Reach Navi Mumbai International Airport\n \tFrom South Mumbai: Freeway → Atal Setu → Ulwe-Belapur Road (~60+ minutes)\n \tFrom Powai: Eastern Express Highway → Vashi Bridge → Thane-Belapur Road → Belapur-Ulwe Road (~60+ minutes)\n \tFrom Thane: Eastern Express Highway → Mumbra-Airoli Road → Thane-Belapur Road → Belapur-Ulwe Road (~70 minutes)\n \tFrom Goregaon: Western Express Highway → Sea Link → Worli → Freeway → Atal Setu → Ulwe-Belapur Road (~90+ minutes)\n \tFrom Mira Road: Ghodbunder Road → Thane-Belapur Road → Belapur-Ulwe Road (~2+ hours; early start recommended)\n\nInside the Airport\n\nNavi Mumbai Airport will have four entry gates, 66 check-in counters, and 22 self-baggage drop counters. After security, passengers enter a spacious shopping and dining zone with 112 retail and F\u0026B outlets, ranging from athleisure and luxury brands to confectionery and cosmetics. Around 45–50 stores will open initially.\n\nAlso Read: PM Modi to visit Maharashtra on October 8-9 to inaugurate major projects | Full schedule here\n\n\n\nBoarding facilities include 29 aerobridge gates and 10 bus gates. The airport aims to become an international hub, enabling direct connections from India to major global cities, reducing dependence on Middle Eastern transit hubs. It is designed for seamless transfers between domestic and international flights without re-clearing customs and immigration. However, realising this hub model will require policy support from the government.(Edited by : Sheersh Kapoor)",

His journey began on October 7, 2001, when he took the oath as the Chief Minister of Gujarat.\n\nExpressing gratitude to the people of India in a series of posts on X, he vowed to work with renewed determination to fulfil the vision of a 'Viksit Bharat'.\n\nOn X, PM Modi said that it has always been his endeavour to enhance people's lives and contribute to the country's progress.\n\n“On this day in 2001, I took the oath as Gujarat’s Chief Minister for the first time. Thanks to the continuous blessings of my fellow Indians, I am entering my 25th year of serving as the head of a Government. My gratitude to the people of India. Through all these years, it has been my constant endeavour to improve the lives of our people and contribute to the progress of this great nation that has nurtured us all,” he wrote.\nOn this day in 2001, I took oath as Gujarat’s Chief Minister for the first time.

First, you will always work for the poor and second, you will never take a bribe,” he added.\n\nHe further mentioned in his post that these 25 years of service had been ‘filled with many experiences’, during which India made ‘remarkable strides’.\nTalking about his tenure as Gujarat CM, he noted that through collective effort, Gujarat became a “powerhouse of good governance”.\n\nOnce drought-prone, the state became a top performer in agriculture, Modi said. “The culture of trading expanded into robust industrial and manufacturing capacities. Regular curfews became a thing of the past. Social and physical infrastructure received a boost. It was very satisfying to be able to work with the people to achieve these outcomes,” he added.\n\nReflecting on national leadership, Modi also looked back on his nomination as the BJP's prime ministerial candidate in 2013, a time when he noted the country was facing a “crisis of trust and governance”.\n\n“The then UPA Government was synonymous with the worst form of corruption, cronyism and policy paralysis. India was seen as a weak link in the global order. But, the wisdom of the people of India gave our alliance a thumping majority and also ensured that our party got an absolute majority, a first after three long decades,” Modi mentioned in his post.\n\nOver the past 11 years, Modi said that India has seen many transformations, empowering citizens, including women, youth, and farmers. “Over the last 11 years, we, The People of India, have worked together and achieved many transformations. Our path-breaking efforts have empowered people from all across India, especially our Nari Shakti, Yuva Shakti and hardworking Annadatas,” Modi said.\n\nHe stated that more than 25 crore people have been lifted out of poverty and that India is now seen as a “bright spot among major global economies”.\n\n“Our farmers are innovating and ensuring that our nation is self-reliant. We have undertaken extensive reforms, and the popular sentiment is to make India Aatmanirbhar across all sectors, reflecting in the clarion call of ‘Garv Se Kaho, Yeh Swadeshi Hai’,” he said.\n\nModi concluded his post by reaffirming his commitment to the people of India and vowing to \"work even harder in the times to come to realise our collective dream of a Viksit Bharat.\"\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is currently the second-longest-serving PM of the country. He recently completed 4,078 consecutive days in office, surpassing former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s uninterrupted tenure of 4,077 days.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

Several parts of the state witnessed heavy rains and floods recently, causing widespread damage.\n\nIt is estimated that crops on over 65-68 lakh hectares were destroyed in the floods. Crops such as cotton, soybean, oranges, pomegranate, maize, bajra, pulses, and onion have been hit the hardest.\n\nAs many as 29 out of 36 districts and 253 (out of 358) talukas suffered due to the heavy rains, the chief minister said.\n\nThe ₹31,000 crore flood relief package will include everything from crop damage compensation to restoring eroded farms,  ex-gratia payments to victims, medical bills, compensation for house damage, etc.\n\nOut of this ₹31,000 crore package, ₹17,675 crore will be provided as crop compensation, ₹30,000 per damaged well, and ₹10,000 per hectare support for the upcoming Rabi season will be provided to farmers.\n\nAs to the loss of livestock, farmers will receive ₹32,000 per animal, he said. While sowing had taken place over a total of 1.43 lakh hectares at the start of the monsoon, crops over 68 lakh hectares of land were damaged, Fadnavis said, adding that as much as 60,000 hectares of farmland were damaged due to the top layer of soil getting washed away.\n\nAlso, 45 lakh farmers who have crop insurance will get ₹17,000 per hectare in insurance money, he said.\n\nThe Opposition had also urged the state to declare a \"wet drought\". Incessant rains in September in various parts of the state, including the capital Mumbai and its metropolitan region, threw life out of gear. Hundreds of people had to be shifted to safety due to flooding, which also damaged crops on a large scale.\n\nA \"wet drought\" is a meteorological phenomenon wherein an area receives abundant rainfall, but the availability of water remains low, causing agricultural loss.First Published: Oct 7, 2025 4:05 PM IST",

The capacity expansion is expected to handle additional freight traffic of about 78 million tonnes per annum.\n\nThe projects will contribute to environmental goals by reducing logistics costs, cutting oil imports by about 28 crore litres, and lowering carbon emissions by around 139 crore kilograms—equivalent to planting six crore trees.",

Some of it is portfolio-driven, but a lot of it also has to do with GST 2.0 for autos,” Nalinikanth said. “We’re quite optimistic about a strong festive season.”\n\nThe company has passed on the full benefit of GST changes to customers, helping to offset price sensitivity amid global raw material volatility.\n\n“Our intent when the government announced the policy was to ensure its benefits reached customers directly, and we did that,” he said. “If the macro environment changes, we’ll reassess, but for now, we’re happy to keep our products attractive.”\n\nMahindra is also preparing to strengthen its presence in the electric vehicle (EV) segment, with a new model set to debut in November. The company believes the segment has firmly entered the mainstream, with Vahan registrations surpassing 14,000 in September—the highest ever for EVs.\n“EVs are clearly a focus area for us. The industry will ultimately move in that direction,” Nalinikanth noted. “With our new launch, we’ll further strengthen that momentum.”\n\nThe company is observing changing buyer behaviour, with customers opting for higher variants or moving directly from hatchbacks to SUVs. “Entry-level SUVs have become more accessible, and we’re seeing many customers trading up within our own SUV lineup,” he added.\n\nWhile Mahindra continues to explore alternative powertrains, compressed natural gas (CNG) is not an immediate priority.\n\n“Right now, CNG doesn’t fully align with our ‘power on tap’ philosophy. But as technology evolves, we’ll keep evaluating it,” he said.\n\nFestive Outlook Strong\n\nWith Navratri driving robust footfall and Diwali approaching, Mahindra expects momentum to continue.\n\n“Footfalls and inquiries have been strong, and we expect them to convert into bookings and retail sales as the season progresses,” Nalinikanth said.\n\nMahindra enters the festive quarter with strong tailwinds—GST-driven affordability, surging SUV demand, and the promise of an EV-powered expansion.(Edited by : Vivek Dubey)",

    "content": "As Karwa Chauth 2025 approaches, women across India prepare to observe a day-long fast for the well-being and longevity of their husbands. To help you stay energised, hydrated, and healthy throughout the day, here are some essential fasting tips to follow.1 / 71. Begin the Day with a Nutritious Sargi | The pre-dawn meal, or Sargi, is crucial for sustaining energy. Include complex carbohydrates like oats or whole-wheat parathas, proteins such as paneer or eggs, and hydrating fruits like watermelon or papaya. Nutritionists recommend avoiding sugary foods early in the morning, as they can cause fatigue later in the day. (Image: Canva)2 / 72. Stay Hydrated Before Sunrise | Hydration is key to avoiding weakness during the fast. Drink plenty of water, coconut water, or lemon-infused water before the fasting period begins. According to health experts, consuming fluids helps maintain electrolyte balance throughout the day. (Image: Canva)3 / 73. Avoid Caffeine and Fried Foods | While it may be tempting to have tea or coffee before the fast, caffeine can lead to dehydration. Instead, opt for herbal tea or milk. Similarly, fried or oily foods can cause acidity, making fasting more difficult. (Image: Canva)4 / 74. Stay Indoors and Avoid Physical Exertion | Since Karwa Chauth involves a full-day fast without food or water, try to rest as much as possible. Avoid strenuous activities or exposure to the sun, as it can lead to exhaustion and dehydration. (Image: Canva)5 / 75. Keep Your Mind Engaged | Distraction helps time pass more easily. Read, watch light shows, or engage in relaxing activities like mehndi application. Staying positive and calm helps maintain mental energy during the long fast. (Image: Canva)6 / 76. Break the Fast Gently | When the moon rises, avoid breaking the fast with heavy or fried foods. Start with water and a few dates to stabilise blood sugar levels, followed by a light meal including soup, rice, and vegetables. (Image: Shutterstock)7 / 77. Focus on Post-Fast Recovery | After a day of fasting, your body needs nourishment. Ensure your dinner includes balanced portions of proteins, carbs, and fibre. Experts suggest sipping warm water or herbal tea to aid digestion before sleeping. (Image: Canva)",

It's used in brake fluids, paints, and lubricants, and is safe only in controlled industrial use. But if it contaminates other consumables, for example — pharmaceutical-grade ingredients, even in trace amounts, it becomes lethal — damaging the kidneys, liver, and nervous system.The recent deaths of more than a dozen children in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, reportedly linked to cough syrups contaminated with Diethylene Glycol, or DEG, have once again brought this industrial toxin under intense scrutiny — exposing deep cracks in India's pharmaceutical quality control.\n\nWhat is DEG?\n\nIt's an industrial solvent — colourless, odourless, and deceptively sweet-tasting. It's used in brake fluids, paints, and lubricants, and is safe only in controlled industrial use. But if it contaminates other consumables, for example — pharmaceutical-grade ingredients, even in trace amounts, it becomes lethal — damaging the kidneys, liver, and nervous system.\n\nAs little as 1 ml per kilogram of body weight can be fatal. In case of adults, 50 to 100 ml can cause death, and for children, even a teaspoon can be fatal.\n\nAlso read | Cough syrup linked deaths: PIL seeks Supreme Court intervention as toll rises, MP bans 2 more drugs\n\nThe mortality rate ranges from 30% to 100%, depending on how quickly treatment begins.\n\nWhile propylene glycol is safe and widely used in medicines, cosmetics, and food, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol are industrial-grade chemicals and are lethal if consumed. As they look, taste, and behave similarly in manufacturing, DEG can slip in if the source material is adulterated — and that has resulted in repeated mass poisonings worldwide, said experts.\n\nExperts highlight that substitution often happens due to cost-cutting, poor supplier oversight, and lax testing, especially among smaller manufacturers. A stark example — in Indonesia, the cough syrups made by Afi Farma in 2022 contained up to 96–99% ethylene glycol. The company did not test its inputs and relied solely on supplier certificates. As a result, several children died.\n\nThis is not the first such tragedy. In 2020, 12 children died in Jammu \u0026 Kashmir. In 2022, at least 66 in Gambia and 18 in Uzbekistan.\n\nAnd now, the latest deaths in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are reportedly linked to contaminated syrups.\n\nExperts warned that unless India tightens raw material testing, ensures traceable supply chains, and enforces strict regulatory vigilance, toxic chemicals like DEG will continue to slip through, turning life-saving medicines into deadly poisons.(Edited by : Priyanka Rathi)",

The Tekton is the second product under Nissan’s “One Car, One World” strategy and will be manufactured in Chennai for India and global markets.\n\nSaurabh Vatsa, Managing Director, Nissan Motor in India, said, \"The All-New Nissan Tekton is going to be at the centre of Nissan’s resurgence story and offers a glimpse into the future of our product portfolio in the country... This model will spearhead Nissan’s growth story in India.\"\n\nThe front features a C-shaped LED daytime running light that wraps around horizontally positioned LED headlamps and connects across the width of the vehicle. The light bar is highlighted by twin chrome slats and the Nissan logo at the centre. A double C-shaped motif on the front fender represents the Himalayas. New Nissan Tekton\n\nThe rear continues the C-shaped theme with an edge-to-edge LED light bar linking angular tail-lamps. The side profile includes flared wheel arches and an upright stance, while the rear door handles are mounted on the pillars.\n\nNissan has not revealed the full interior yet, but it is expected to share the layout with the new Renault Duster, using different materials, chrome accents, and trims for a more premium look.\n\nTop variants are likely to feature an infotainment touchscreen, digital instrument cluster, 360-degree camera, rear AC vents, automatic climate control, and multiple drive modes. The infotainment system will share hardware with the Duster but use brand-specific software and UI.\n\nSafety is expected to include up to six airbags and driver-assistance systems, though it is unclear if ADAS tech from the international Duster will be included. New Nissan Tekton\n\nThe Tekton is expected to be powered by a 1.3-litre turbo-petrol engine producing 154 hp and 250 Nm, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Nissan has not confirmed if manual or AWD variants will be available at launch. A 7-seat version is planned by the end of FY2026, alongside the Renault-badged sibling.\n\nThe SUV will compete in the C-SUV segment, including the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, and Toyota Hyryder, and will sit above the Magnite in Nissan’s lineup.",

What is your source of livelihood?” Justice Kant also demanded official proof of his parentage, asking, “Who are you? What is your right? Please show us any official document declaring you as the father of the minors.”\n\n“What were you doing in Goa? Did you have any valid documents to stay in this country? You went to Nepal and extended your visa, and then again went to Goa,” he further asked.\n\n“What were you doing when your children were living in a cave?” asked Justice Bagchi.\n\nGoldstein's lawyer, Deepak Prakash, asked the court for more time to verify whether the children had already been sent back and to serve a copy of the petition to the Centre. The Supreme Court, however, refused to adjourn the matter and allowed Goldstein to withdraw his petition.\n\nEarlier, in July, Karnataka Police rescued 40-year-old Russian national Nina Kutina and her two daughters during a routine patrol in the Ramatirtha Hills forest in Gokarna, Kumta taluk. The family had been living in the forest for nearly two months without valid travel or residence documents. Following their rescue, they were sent to a Foreigners Restriction Centre for Women.\n\nOn September 28, Kutina, along with her two daughters and minor son, who was located separately in Goa, were flown back to Russia after being found living in India without valid documents.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "HomeIndia NewsFarmers in flood-hit Maharashtra say recovery may take up to five yearsFarmers across flood-hit districts of Maharashtra are grappling with massive crop losses and soil erosion that threaten their long-term livelihoods. While the state government has announced compensation and sought central assistance, many fear that relief measures may be delayed or insufficient to help them rebuild their farms and recover from the devastation.Torrential rains and severe flooding have left a trail of destruction across Maharashtra, with 31 out of the state’s 36 districts reeling under water. The floods have damaged crops spread over more than 50 lakh hectares, devastating the livelihoods of thousands of farmers who now fear a long and uncertain road to recovery.\n\nCrops such as cotton, soybean, oranges, pomegranate, maize, bajra, pulses, and onion have been hit the hardest. Many farmers say their fields have been rendered infertile due to soil erosion and the deposition of stones carried by the floodwaters.\n\n“Soybean’s cost of production is ₹50,000 per hectare. Had the rains not destroyed my crops, I would have earned at least ₹2 lakh,” said Rajendra Akolkar, a farmer from Ahilyanagar district, whose fields were submerged during the torrential downpour.\n\nThe Maharashtra government has said that crops across 31 districts have suffered extensive damage and that it has sanctioned compensation of over ₹2,000 crore for more than 31 lakh affected farmers. However, farmers in some of the worst-hit regions told CNBC-TV18 that the losses go far beyond crop destruction, with long-term impacts on soil fertility and productivity. “It will take us four to five years to recover,” said another farmer from Karanji village.\n\nWhile the state government maintains that the situation continues to remain grim, it has sought assistance from the Centre under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) quota. The opposition and farmer groups, however, are demanding that the government declare this a ‘wet drought’ year to ensure larger financial relief and policy support.\n\nThe state has initiated surveys to assess the extent of damage and determine the compensation to be paid, but the opposition alleges that the government is failing to act decisively. Meanwhile, many farmers fear that the aid, even if sanctioned, may be delayed or inadequate.\n\nWith farmlands still waterlogged and crops destroyed, Maharashtra’s agrarian economy faces a major setback. For many farmers, rebuilding their livelihoods and restoring their fields to productivity may take years—a recovery that, as they say, “won’t be easy or quick.”",

A red alert has been issued for Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri districts, while Darjeeling faces an orange alert. (Image: PTI)8 / 9Long-Term Causes | Experts and environmentalists have warned that human activities, including deforestation, unplanned construction, and poor drainage systems, have made Darjeeling’s fragile slopes highly vulnerable to landslides. They urged stricter enforcement of construction norms, climate-sensitive development, and decentralised disaster planning to prevent such tragedies in the future. (Image: PTI)9 / 9Historical Echoes | Sunday’s disaster echoes past tragedies, including the deadly 1968 deluge that killed nearly 1,000 people, highlighting the ongoing vulnerability of the region to extreme weather events intensified by climate change. Officials described the disaster as the worst since the 2015 landslides that killed nearly 40 people in the region. (Image: PTI)",

However, if the atmosphere of the state is impacted by your becoming a minister or holding a post of power, then we have to ensure that the scheme of justice prevails,\" the bench said.\n\nSibal said there was not a word in the April 28 order about Balaji becoming a minister and there can't be any injunction by the court on his becoming a minister while he is being prosecuted.\n\nJustice Kant questioned Sibal as to why the application for clarification was filed after apex court judge Justice Abhay S Oka, who asked him to resign as minister in Tamil Nadu government, has retired.\n\nRead more: Bihar Election Date 2025 Live Updates\n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Enforcement Directorate, also questioned the timing of the application and said that it was not in good taste.\n\nJustice Kant told Sibal, \"This court has not prevented you from taking over the post of the minister and it can't prevent you. But after it was found that on becoming minister just days after being granted bail, you were exercising some influence in the trial of cases, the court said it is better you go to jail\".\n\nSibal pointed out that maybe this was in the court's mind but it was not reflected from the order and hence this application was filed.\n\nJustice Bagchi said there were allegations of influence and the court found that these were prima facie correct.\n\nBoth Mehta and senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the victims of the scam, took the bench through sequence of orders passed in the matter and said that the court on April 23 gave an ultimatum to Balaji and asked him to make a choice \"between post and freedom\" as it warned him of cancelling bail if he did not step down as minister.\n\nSensing the mood of the court, Sibal sought permission to withdraw the plea.\n\nThe bench allowed him to withdraw the plea seeking clarification.\n\nIn another matter related to Balaji, where victims have approached the court seeking appointment of a special public prosecutor, the bench asked the Tamil Nadu government why these cash-for-job scam cases involving the former minister and state officials be not transferred to Delhi or some other neutral place.\nRead more: Cough syrup killing children: Maharashtra, Telangana flag Coldrif batches after deaths in MP, Rajasthan\n\nSenior advocates Abhishek Singhvi and Amit Anand Tiwari, appearing for the Tamil Nadu government, opposed the suggestion of the court saying that it will be a reflection on state judiciary that nothing is being done in these cases.\n\n\"We are only giving a suggestion that why not transfer the trial to Delhi or to some other neutral ground because the investigation is complete and only trial remains.

This is the court's suggestion because whenever a high state functionary or a minister is involved in criminal cases, allegations of influence or delay in trial are bound to be made,\" the bench said.\n\nSinghvi and Tiwari sought time to file their response on the issue saying the response of the accused needs to be seen on the issue of transfer of trial outside the state.\n\nSankaranarayanan submitted that when a former chief minister of the state was involved in a criminal case, the trial was shifted to Karnataka and the court can think on that line also.\n\nThe bench said it will look into it and took on record a chart of leading lawyers submitted by Sankaranarayanan for being appointed as special public prosecutors.\n\nIt also asked the state government counsels to submit some names who can be appointed as special public prosecutors.\n\nThe top court was hearing a petition filed by Y Balaji, challenging the March 28 Madras High Court order dismissing pleas against the clubbing of multiple chargesheets in cases related to the alleged scam.\n\nOn July 30, terming the trial involving Balaji a \"rudderless ship\", the top court said a cricket stadium will be needed to conduct prosecution in the cash-for-job scam related cases where over 2,000 people have been implicated as accused.\n\nRead more: Bihar elections: Voting in two phases on Nov 6 and 11, result on Nov 14, announces EC\n\nIt had pulled up the Tamil Nadu government for implicating so many persons as accused, questioned whether they are victims or victimisers and asked for the details of the accused and witnesses.\n\nThe top court had said it appears to be the most populated trial of India with 2,000 accused and 500 witnesses and that a small courtroom would not suffice.\n\nBalaji resigned from the M K Stalin-led state Cabinet on April 27 after being pulled up by the top court.\n\nOn April 23, the apex court took exception to the fact that Balaji was reinstated as a minister, days after he obtained bail in a money laundering case related to the alleged cash-for-jobs scam.\n\nOn September 26, 2024, the top court granted bail to Balaji in a case probed by the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nWith Balaji spending more than 15 months in jail, the top court had observed that there was no possibility that the trial would be concluded in the near future.",

Perhaps the beginning of a lifelong obsession, she would climb trees in her home and watch warplanes over the Burma front.\n\nDuring a period when women were expected to conform to predefined roles, Dhira was lucky to have a father, Kamaleshwar Chaliha, who supported her in following her dreams. Following her graduation from Guwahati's Handique College, Dhira noticed an advertisement in 1959 that would forever transform her life: the Assam Flying Club offered six fully-funded scholarships for pilot training.\nShe applied.\n\nDhira would practise flying in Tiger Moths and the indigenous Pushpak, two-seater propeller aircraft, twice a week. Each flight taught not only technical abilities but also courage, patience, and precision because there were no modern conveniences like sophisticated navigation or dependable radio contact.\n\nDhira Chaliha became the first female pilot of Assam when she earned her Pilot’s A Licence in April 1961, at the age of 21. Her solo flight was from Borjhar to Tezpur. While she was flying between Guwahati, Tezpur, Jorhat, and Shillong, the people of Azara gathered to watch her land.\n\nDespite the practical challenges she faced—such as difficult terrain and no radio communication—she mainly recalls the excitement.\n\nDhira had to make some sacrifices along the way. She wanted to become a commercial pilot, but her priorities changed when she married Kamal Hazarika and moved to London. Her decision to put her family before her profession was one that many women in her generation were forced to make.\n\nHowever, Dhira would continue going to flying clubs in London to tell everyone about her passion for flying.\n\nOver 60 years later, Dhira flew again over England in a Tiger Moth at the age of 85, marking one of the most poignant moments in her life. She flew over Berkshire and the River Thames with Captain John Towell at the controls.\n\nThis specific Tiger Moth was not a typical aircraft; it had been in Hollywood productions such as Thunderbirds and The King's Speech.\n\nAs the first woman pilot in Assam, Dhira is currently writing her autobiography, which will chronicle her years in the sky.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "The University of Western Australia will open campuses in Mumbai and Chennai, marking one of the first major foreign university entries into India’s $100-billion higher education market.The University of Western Australia (UWA), one of the Australia's prestigious Group of Eight (Go8) institutions, has announced plans to establish two campuses in India—one in Mumbai and another in Chennai—making it one of the first major foreign universities to enter the Indian higher education market after the government allowed international institutions to set up independent campuses.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC-TV18, Professor Guy Littlefair, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education and Student Experience) at UWA, said the decision reflects the university’s long-term commitment to India’s rapidly expanding education sector and its potential to become a global hub for higher learning.\n\n“The University of Western Australia is looking at establishing two campuses, one in Mumbai and one in Chennai,” he said. “We absolutely believe we have an opportunity for students in India and from around the region to come to India and have a world-leading qualification.”\n\nProfessor Littlefair said India’s location and demographics make it one of the most significant regions for international education growth over the next two decades. “We will have to wait and see how India performs as an international education destination, but it is certainly going to be a hub,” he noted. “Given the policy changes by the University Grants Commission and the government’s decision to welcome foreign universities, we felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”\n\nHe added that UWA’s entry is not a short-term move but part of a broader strategy to build a sustained academic presence in India. “This is not for the short term, we are here for the long term,” he said. “We are looking to develop a comprehensive university offering programs across the arts, humanities, techno-sciences, and health.”\n\nIndia’s higher education market, estimated at around 100 billion dollars, has become increasingly attractive for global institutions. Professor Littlefair said UWA sees the move as both an academic and economic opportunity. “It is a big market for sure, and one that provides significant stimulus to the economy,” he said.\n\nExplaining the choice of cities, he said Mumbai represents India’s financial heart and has a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem, making it a natural location for the university’s expansion. Chennai, on the other hand, has a high demand for studies in engineering, computer science and the techno-sciences. “For us, setting up in both cities was an easy decision,” he said.\n\nUWA has already received a letter of intention from the University Grants Commission and is working towards establishing its physical presence in India. Professor Littlefair said the university anticipates opening its doors to students by August next year.\n\nThe university is still assessing whether to establish the campuses independently or through a joint venture with an Indian partner. “We are working through whether to set up as a joint venture or on our own. There are pros and cons on both sides,” he said. “Whatever happens, we will be delivering something significant here in India for students who are looking for such opportunities in the future.”\n\nHe also assured that the quality of education at the India campuses will match UWA’s standards in Australia. “We have to provide courses offshore to the same standard as those we provide in Australia,” he explained. “There will be some local nuances, but the offerings will be identical in quality.”\n\nUWA will focus strongly on student experience, offering a blend of classroom learning, field work, community engagement and research-based internships. “We focus on the student experience, not just in the classroom but through field work and community engagement,” he said. “We leverage our research expertise and offer internships and work-integrated learning.”\n\nWhile Professor Littlefair did not disclose the scale of investment, he confirmed that it would be substantial. “Establishing two campuses in a foreign country is a significant investment, but one that is well worth making,” he said. “We see nothing but great opportunity here in India.”\n\nWith this move, India’s goal of becoming a global education hub appears to be taking firm shape, as foreign universities begin to translate policy reforms into on-ground partnerships and campuses.",

    "title": "Sabarimala gold plating scandal: Kerala HC orders SIT probe; uproar in assembly",
    "content": "HomeIndia NewsSabarimala gold plating scandal: Kerala HC orders SIT probe; uproar in assemblyThe High Court Devaswom Bench has asked the SIT to keep the probe fully private and not reveal any information.The Kerala High Court on Monday, October 6, directed the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct a probe into the alleged theft of gold from the Sabarimala temple.\n\nLed by former Superintendent of Police S Sasidharan, the investigation will be overseen by Crime Branch chief Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) H Venkatesh and will consist of three inspectors, including cyber experts.\n\nThe High Court Devaswom Bench has asked the SIT to keep the probe fully private and not reveal any information. The order dates back to 2019, when the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) removed the gold-lined copper plates.\n\nThe problem worsened when Unnikrishnan Potty stated that two gold-plated panels presented to the temple in 2019 were stolen from the strongroom, right before the TDB-sponsored Global Ayyappa Sangamam event.\n\nRecently, IDB surveillance discovered the ‘missing’ goods; however, it was claimed that approximately 5 kg of weight was removed from the plates. According to Kerala Devaswom Minister V N Vasavan, the TDB vigilance will submit the report to the High Court on October 8.\n\nOver 5 kg of gold is missing from Sabarimala donations\n\nOn Monday, Congress MLA and Leader of Opposition in the Kerala Assembly, VD Satheesan, alleged that over 5 kilograms of gold donated by the UB Group and Vijay Mallya to the temple were misappropriated. He demanded a CBI probe under the supervision of the Kerala High Court.\n\nIn a conversation with ANI, he said, “This is a very serious matter... UB Group and Vijay Mallaya donated more than 30 kg of gold to the Sabarimala Temple for plating various things. Unfortunately, through some middlemen, more than 5kg of that gold was robbed.”\n\nMismatch between old and current gold-plated panels detected\n\nThe Devaswom Board Vigilance found that the gold-plated panels on the sanctum are different from the 2019 ones, possibly indicating the loss of panels plated with gold donated by Vijay Mallya, according to a report in Mathrubhumi. This conclusion was drawn from photographic comparisons and supported by a goldsmith's assessment.\n\nThe current gold-plated panels at the Sabarimala sanctum sanctorum do not match photographs of the panels from before July 2019. This suggests that the gold panels plated with Vijay Mallya's donated gold in 2019 may have gone missing.\n\nA goldsmith consulted during the inquiry also concluded that the panels are not the same. The vigilance intends to seek High Court permission for forensic tests to definitively determine the age and authenticity of the panels.\n\nUproar in Kerala Assembly \n\nEarlier in the day, the Kerala Legislative Assembly witnessed high drama as the Opposition created an uproar over the gold-plating controversy. During the Question Hour, Opposition leader VD Satheesan raised the issue and demanded the resignation of the Devaswom Minister and the Travancore Devaswom Board President.\n\nOpposition MLAs surrounded the Speaker's podium, carrying placards and banners with messages such as “Ayyappan's gold stolen, temple devoured by looters,” obstructing his vision. As the situation became serious, ministers and members of the ruling front stood up from their seats.\n\nAmid the ruckus, Speaker AN Shamseer cancelled Question Hour and momentarily adjourned the House. “Why disrupt the House without even giving a single notice?” he said.\n\nTDB Vigilance records statement of Unnikrishnan Potty\n\nOn Sunday, the TDB Vigilance recorded the statement of the former helper and the sponsor of gold-plating works at Sabarimala, Unnikrishnan Potty. He was questioned for nearly three hours at the headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nIn response to the media's questions, he said, \"Don't I have freedom as an individual? Everything will be proven before the High Court. Don't I have the right to move freely? The truth will prevail.”\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu to visit Sabarimala temple\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu is scheduled to visit the temple on the concluding day of the Thulamasa Pooja on October 22. She is set to be in Kerala for a two-day visit, till October 24, and attend several programmes in the Thiruvananthapuram and Kottayam areas.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "HomeIndia NewsNamma Metro: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah proposes renaming it 'Basava Metro'; netizens reactOn Sunday, Siddaramaiah recommended renaming the Namma Metro to \"Basava Metro\" in honour of 12th-century social reformer Basavanna.Bengaluru's famed metro train network may soon witness a significant change as Chief Minister Siddaramaiah announced plans to rename Namma Metro.\n\nOn Sunday, Siddaramaiah recommended renaming the Namma Metro to ‘Basava Metro’ in honour of 12th-century social reformer Basavanna. During a public gathering on October 5, the Chief Minister stated that he would forward the proposal to the Central government.\n\nOn X, Siddaramaiah stated that if it were a totally state government project, he would have announced it as such right away.\n\n“I will recommend to the central government to name our metro as ‘Basava Metro.’ If this were entirely a state government project, I would have announced it as ‘Basava Metro’ today itself. We have many castes and many religions among us. In the Chaturvarna system, we are placed in the fourth position. Regardless of which caste Shudras belong to, we must realise that we are all one,” he wrote on X.\n\nCM Siddaramaiah further mentioned that he was an admirer of Basavanna, adding, “My belief is that Basava's principles are eternal and relevant--not just in the past, not just today, but forever.”\nನಮ್ಮ ಮೆಟ್ರೋಗೆ \"ಬಸವ ಮೆಟ್ರೋ\" ಎಂದು ನಾಮಕರಣ ಮಾಡುವ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಕೇಂದ್ರಕ್ಕೆ ಶಿಫಾರಸ್ಸು ಮಾಡುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಇದು ಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ರಾಜ್ಯ ಸರ್ಕಾರದ ಯೋಜನೆ ಆಗಿದ್ದರೆ ಇವತ್ತೇ \"ಬಸವ ಮೆಟ್ರೋ\" ಎಂದು ಘೋಷಿಸಿ ಬಿಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದೆ.\nನಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ ಅನೇಕ ಜಾತಿ, ಅನೇಕ‌ ಧರ್ಮಗಳಿವೆ. ಚಾತುವರ್ಣ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಾಲ್ಕನೇ ಸ್ಥಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಇರುವವರು ನಾವು. ಶೂದ್ರರು ಜಾತಿ… pic.twitter.com/k5yUD34UaA\n\n— Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) October 5, 2025\n\nThe proposal triggered widespread public discussion, with some Bengalureans arguing that the name was a cherished part of the city's identity and should not be changed.\nMany argued that instead of renaming infrastructure projects, the government should prioritise practical issues like expediting under-construction metro lines and reducing peak-hour congestion.\n\n“Our metro's name is nice. If we want to name it after Basavanna, we should name a new station after him,” a user wrote in the comment section.\n\nAnother said, “Namma Metro Name is Enough for our Metro. Instead of doing this, focus on developing the city where Basavanna was born.”\n\n“Why didn't you then name your children \u0026 and grandchildren to honour Basavanna. Pls stop the appeasement politics. Why can't it be Namma Metro? It's funded by people’s tax, which goes to the State coffers. You haven't paid it from your own pockets,” the third user posted.\n\n“Repair Bengaluru roads first. People are falling and getting hurt. Taking care of citizens should be your top priorities. We are paying huge taxes. Where is going???” a user wrote. “Bengalureans should oppose this. Namma Metro is an iconic name, it should remain as it is,” one user commented.\n\n“First reduce metro ticket prices, then think about renaming it,” another said.\n\nThis is not the first time a name change related to Bengaluru's metro has stirred debate. A proposal in September 2025 to rename the Shivajinagar Metro station after St. Mary's caused a political controversy. Announcing the plans, Siddaramaiah stated the state would announce it’s renaming once the central government approves.\n\nAt the annual feast of St Mary’s Basilica on September 8, he said, “There is a proposal to name a metro station after St. Mary. Rizwan and I have spoken about it because Rizwan is the MLA of this constituency. I will make a recommendation to the central government.” The announcement had triggered a political storm, with many strongly objecting to the move.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "HomeIndia NewsHealthcare NewsIndia to revise CGHS rates from October 13: What may change for hospitals and beneficiariesCGHS offers cashless medical treatment to central government employees, pensioners, and their dependents.The government has approved a comprehensive revision of rates under the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), marking the first major overhaul in close to 15 years. The updated pricing, covering nearly 2,000 medical procedures, will come into effect on October 13.\n\nCGHS offers cashless medical treatment to central government employees, pensioners, and their dependents.\n\nThe revised framework introduces a multidimensional pricing structure, with rates now linked to hospital accreditation status, facility type, city classification, and ward entitlement.\n\nUnder the new system, National Accreditation Board for Hospitals (NABH) or National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)-accredited hospitals will serve as the benchmark for base rates. Non-accredited hospitals will receive 15% lower reimbursements. Super-specialty hospitals will be eligible for 15% higher rates, while facilities in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities will be compensated at 10–20% below metro-level pricing.\n\nHospitals had been seeking an upward revision for several years, arguing that package rates—unchanged since 2014—had failed to keep pace with medical inflation.\n\nIn several instances, healthcare providers had either delayed or declined cashless CGHS treatments due to viability concerns.\n\nAnalysts estimate that the revised schedule translates into an average increase of 25–30% across high-volume procedures, with super-specialty centres receiving an additional 15% premium over standard NABH-linked rates.\n\nListed healthcare chains such as Max Healthcare, Narayana Health, Yatharth Hospitals, and Fortis are among those with higher exposure to CGHS patients and are therefore expected to see financial gains.\n\nSector experts say the move is likely to strengthen cash flows for Tier-1 and super-specialty hospitals, although timely settlement of dues will remain critical as the revised structure is rolled out.",

    "title": "Harvest Moon 2025: Why it’s in October instead of September this year",
    "content": "While the Harvest Moon typically appears in September, it can sometimes fall in early October. The timing depends not on the month itself, but on which full moon is closest to the autumn equinox.The Harvest Moon of 2025 will light up the skies tonight, October 6, marking one of the brightest and most beautiful full moons of the year. Interestingly, this year’s Harvest Moon is appearing in October, not September – a rare but completely natural occurrence. Here’s why it happens and what makes it special.\n\nWhat Is the Harvest Moon?\n\nThe Harvest Moon is the name given to the full moon that occurs closest to the autumnal equinox, typically falling around September 22.\n\nCenturies ago, this moon provided extra evening light to farmers harvesting their crops, helping them work later into the night. Over time, it became known as the Harvest Moon – a symbol of abundance and the changing of seasons.\n\nWhy is it in October in 2025?\n\nWhile the Harvest Moon typically appears in September, it can sometimes fall in early October. The timing depends not on the month itself, but on which full moon is closest to the autumn equinox.\n\nIn 2025, the September full moon occurred on September 7, nearly two weeks before the equinox – too early to earn the title. The next full moon, on October 6, occurs just after the equinox, making it the closest one and officially the Harvest Moon of 2025.\nThis shift happens due to the Moon’s 29.5-day orbit and the slight variations in how its cycle aligns with the solar calendar each year. These natural adjustments occasionally push the Harvest Moon into October, as they did this year.\n\nHistorically, an October Harvest Moon is rare, and based on current lunar-solar cycle patterns, such October occurrences typically repeat every two to three years. The last time one occurred was in 2020, and astronomical forecasts suggest the next October Harvest Moon will be in 2028.\n\nA Rare Supermoon Appearance\n\nAdding to the excitement, tonight’s Harvest Moon is also a supermoon – meaning it occurs when the Moon is near its closest point to Earth in its orbit.\n\nDue to this proximity, the Moon will appear larger and brighter than usual, glowing with a warm golden hue as it rises over the horizon. Stargazers can expect a breathtaking view shortly after sunset.\n\nWhen and How to Watch the Harvest Moon Tonight\n\nThe Harvest Moon will rise around sunset on Monday, October 6, and stay visible through the night.\n\nFor the best viewing experience:\n \tLook toward the eastern horizon just after sunset.\n \tChoose a clear, open area away from artificial lights.\n \tThe Moon will appear especially golden or orange when it is low in the sky, gradually becoming brighter as it rises higher.\n\nViewers across India, Europe, and North America should have excellent visibility, weather permitting.(Edited by : Priyanka Deshpande)",

    "content": "Maserati has launched the MCPura supercar in India, offering Coupe and Cielo variants with a 3.0L V6 engine, top speed of 325 km/h, and prices starting at ₹4.12 crore.1 / 7Maserati Debuts: Italian automaker Maserati recently launched the MC Pura in India. The supercar is available in two variants: the hardtop Coupe and the open-roof Cielo. The Coupe starts at ₹4.12 crore, while the Cielo is priced at Rs 5.12 crore (ex-showroom). Both models are powered by a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine and are mechanically identical to their international counterparts.2 / 7Design Updates: The MC Pura retains the MC20 silhouette but features design updates. The grille has a dark surround, and the front splitter is modified. Air intakes below the headlamps are larger. At the rear, the bumper has subtle refinements. Maserati worked with Dallara to enhance the car’s aerodynamic efficiency. The coupe has a matte finish, while the convertible has a glossy finish.3 / 7Signature Badging: Exterior branding receives a visual update. The Trident emblems on the grille and C-pillar, MCPura lettering on the flanks, and wheel center caps feature magenta with blue mica particles. Glossy finishes appear on the coupe, while matte finishes highlight the Cielo. The badges contrast against the body paint, giving the supercars a distinct visual identity compared to the MC20.4 / 7Engine Performance: Both variants use the 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged Nettuno V6, producing 621 horsepower and 719–730 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The Coupe accelerates from 0–100 km/h in 2.9 seconds, while the Cielo does it in 3.0 seconds. Both reach a top speed of 325 km/h.5 / 7Interior Features: The MCPura cabin follows the MC20 layout with new touches. Seats feature laser-etched Alcantara with vertical striping and contrasting red and blue tones. The dashboard has a digital instrument cluster, central touchscreen, and three-spoke steering wheel with engine start/stop and shift paddles. Carbon fibre trims line the cabin. The Cielo has matte detailing, while the Coupe features glossy interior accents.6 / 7Maserati MCPura7 / 7Model Evolution: The MCPura replaces the MC20 in India. Its global debut occurred at the Goodwood Festival of Speed earlier this year. The MCPura is an evolution of the MC20 with subtle styling changes and a refreshed paint palette. Mechanically, both models remain unchanged. The Cielo convertible is priced ₹19 lakh lower than the MC20 Cielo available in India since May.",

We are not distracted. These things do not affect me,\" Justice Gavai was quoted as saying by Bar and Bench.\nThe incident was possibly linked with CJI Gavai's earlier remarks in a case related to the restoration of the Lord Vishnu idol at the Khajuraho group of temples.\n\n\"Go and ask the deity itself to do something now. You say you are a staunch devotee of Lord Vishnu. So go and pray now. It’s an archaeological site and ASI needs to give permission etc,\" CJI Gavai had reportedly remarked while dismissing the plea, as per B\u0026B.\n\nHis remarks, however, led to a controversy on social media after the remarks were widely shared, alleging that the statement hurt religious sentiments.\n\nLater, the CJI had clarified that he respects all religions and did not mean to hurt the sentiments of any community. \"I respect all religions,\" CJI Gavai had said.\n\nThe Supreme Court's security unit initiated an inquiry into the attack incident, as per a news agency PTI.\n\nFormer secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Advocate Rohit Pandey criticised the act and called for action in the case. \"Today's incident is a very sad one. If a lawyer has committed or attempted to commit assault in a court, we strongly condemn it. He is a member of our bar. We recently inquired and found out that he is a member of the 2011 Bar. But it is a very sad incident,\" Pandey told news agency ANI.\n\n\"He (the lawyer) attempted this based on the comment made by the CJI in the case of a Lord Vishnu matter. This is a very sad incident. We strongly condemn this, and if this incident is true, action should be taken,\" he added.\n\nFurther details are awaited in the matter.First Published: Oct 6, 2025 1:24 PM IST",

    "content": "NASA said the supermoon will dominate the sky on Monday, October 6, the night the Draconid meteor shower is expected to start.The first supermoon of 2025 will be visible to skywatchers worldwide on the night of October 6 as the Harvest Moon reaches its closest and fullest point, appearing up to 30% brighter and 14% bigger than a normal full moon.\n\nThis particular lunar spectacle expands as the Harvest Moon — the full moon that falls closest to the autumnal equinox (this year on September 22) — a traditional marker in various cultures for the harvesting season.\n\nAccording to NASA, the supermoon will dominate the sky on October 6, the night the Draconid meteor shower is expected to start. However, the Harvest Moon in October might be too bright for people to appreciate the meteor shower completely.\n\nTiming and Viewing Tips\n\nThe Harvest Supermoon will rise in the eastern sky on Monday, October 6, at 6:55 pm ET and set at 8:05 am ET the following day. Additionally, the moon will be full when it rises at 7:28 pm ET on Tuesday.\n\nThe full moon is predicted to achieve its maximum brightness around 11:48 pm ET on October 6 (early October 7 in UTC). Beginning on the evening of October 5 and continuing through October 7, the moon will be nearly full in many locations.\n\nExperts advise viewing the Moon shortly after moonrise or close to moonset, when it is low on the horizon and its shape looks exaggerated due to an atmospheric phenomenon called the ‘moon illusion,’ for the most dramatic views.\n\nLook for a spot with an open view; fields, parks, and waterfronts are excellent spots to observe the scenery.\n\nIt is advised to use a tripod for photography. Consider adding foreground objects (trees, buildings) to provide a sense of scale, and use slower exposures to prevent overexposure of the bright lunar disc.\n\nWhy It Happens\n\nA ‘supermoon’ happens when the moon is both full and close to perigee, the point in its elliptical orbit that comes closest to Earth. Although the change is barely noticeable for many casual observers, the moon may appear substantially bigger and brighter than usual due to its proximity.\n\nThe moon will come close to Earth during the most recent viewing, approximately 224,600 miles (361,459 km) away. Three supermoons in 2025 will follow after this one, with the following two being on November 5 (Beaver Supermoon) and December 4 (Cold Moon Supermoon).\n\nTwo lunar eclipses will occur in 2026: A total eclipse in March that will be visible from most of North America, Asia, and Australia, and a partial eclipse in August that will be visible from the Americas, Africa, and Europe.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

Multiple teams are looking for the accused,” the officer added.\n\nIn a similar case reported in August, a 24-year-old woman was alleged to have been gang raped by four men at a party in north Delhi's Civil Lines.\n\nThe victim had alleged that a male friend had invited her to a party at a friend’s house, where the accused spiked her drinks and raped her.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

Several radar systems, command and control units, and air defence installations were also hit in targeted missile strikes across multiple airbases.\nOne of the most significant hits occurred at PAF Bholari Airbase, where an F-16 jet parked in a hangar was destroyed, resulting in the death of five PAF personnel, including a Squadron Leader and Chief Technician. The AWACS Erieye, also hit at Bholari, was later repaired by US Air Force engineers flown in urgently.\nFurther damage was reported at:\nPAF Shahbaz Air Base (Jacobabad) – Two F-16s destroyed in hangars\nNur Khan Airbase (Rawalpindi) – One F-16 and a C-130 hit in a precision strike\nSarghodha, Rahim Yar Khan, and Mushaf Airbase – Infrastructure like runways, hangars, and communication systems severely damaged.\nHigh-level Pakistani defence sources revealed that $400–$470 million in secret emergency funds were approved in late May for repairs and upgrades. The United States reportedly blocked China from assisting in the repairs over concerns of technology theft, particularly related to the F-16s and C-130 aircraft.\nTo expedite repairs, the US dispatched special teams from Al-Udeid Airbase (Doha), Al Dhafra (Abu Dhabi), and Bethesda (Maryland) after Field Marshal Asim Munir personally requested help during meetings with US President Donald Trump and retired CENTCOM Chief Michael Kurilla.\nMultiple US military flights (C-17s and C-130s) were tracked landing at Nur Khan Airbase between June and September, confirming covert US activity on Pakistani soil. The US support was further acknowledged when Pakistan awarded General Kurilla its highest military honour in July 2025.\nWhile most damage has now been repaired, sources indicate Rahim Yar Khan’s airbase runway remains out of service due to ongoing flooding in South Punjab. PAF is also fast-tracking upgrades with a hybrid American-Chinese satellite-integrated radar system, intended to prevent future vulnerabilities.\nThe revelation underscores the scale, precision, and aftermath of Operation Sindoor, which inflicted strategic damage to Pakistan’s air capabilities and revealed Islamabad’s growing reliance on US military assistance despite rising Chinese collaboration.",

    "title": "Planning to buy a house: 5 hidden costs that can raise your total price",
    "content": "Buying a home? The price per square foot isn’t the full story. Stamp duty, GST, maintenance, parking, and legal fees can add 10–12% to your total cost.1 / 7Planning a House: The price per square foot is often the first figure buyers look at when considering a home. But this is not the complete picture. Several extra charges come along with the purchase, and they can raise the total cost by around 10 to 12%. (Image: Pixabay)2 / 7Stamp Duty Costs: One of the largest expenses is stamp duty and registration. This varies by state, usually falling between 5 and 7% of the agreement value. For example, on a flat priced at ₹1 crore, stamp duty and registration will cost an additional ₹5–7 lakh, which must be paid upfront. (Image: Pixabay)3 / 7GST on Homes: Goods and Services Tax (GST) also applies in certain cases. Ready-to-move-in homes are free from GST. However, if the property is under construction, buyers must pay 5% GST. For affordable housing projects, the rate is lower, at 1%. (Image: Pixabay)4 / 7Maintenance Charges: Builders usually collect advance maintenance charges covering one to two years. These payments go toward upkeep of amenities like lifts, clubhouse, security, and landscaping. In addition, buyers are asked to contribute to a one-time corpus fund, which serves as a reserve for the future needs of the housing society. (Image: Pixabay)5 / 7Parking and Floors: Parking spaces and floor-rise charges are separate from the base price of the property. Covered parking slots and apartments on higher floors usually come at a premium. In metro cities, these add-ons can amount to several lakhs, making a notable difference in the final payable amount. (Image: Pixabay)6 / 7Legal and Brokerage: Legal and brokerage expenses are another component. Even when dealing directly with developers, buyers should expect to spend around 1% of the property value on brokerage fees. In addition, legal verification of documents generally costs between ₹25,000 and ₹50,000. (Image: Pixabay)7 / 7Final Price Check: When setting a budget for property purchase, it is important not to rely only on the builder’s quoted rate. By adding a buffer of 10 to 12% for stamp duty, taxes, charges, and fees, buyers will have a clearer view of the actual financial requirement. In real estate, the headline price is rarely the final cost. (Image: Pixabay)",

Companies cited price competition from overseas providers as a key factor restraining growth in foreign sales.\n\nStill, business confidence regarding the year ahead improved to a six-month high. Firms cited planned advertising campaigns, expected efficiency gains, competitive pricing strategies and anticipated tax cuts as reasons for optimism.\n\nHowever, employment growth maintained a modest pace in September, with fewer than 5% of surveyed companies reporting new hiring.\n\nBoth input cost pressures and price increases charged by service providers eased from August. Firms passed on extra costs to their consumers at the shallowest rate since March.\n\nIndia's inflation rose in August to 2.07% from July's 1.61%, ending a nine-month streak of decline. But it was well within the Reserve Bank of India's target range of 2-6%.

    "content": "In the backdrop of recent concerns over the quality and use of cough syrups, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Sunday, October 5, convened a high-level review meeting with all States and Union Territories (UT) under the chairmanship of Union Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava.\n\nThe meeting reviewed compliance with drug quality norms, particularly the Revised Schedule M for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and discussed measures to promote rational use of cough syrups, especially in paediatric populations, said a press statement from the union health ministry.\n\nThe review was held following directions from Union Health Minister JP Nadda, who had earlier instructed that States and UTs be engaged to ensure all necessary actions are taken promptly to prevent any recurrence of safety lapses.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Amit Agarwal, Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers; Dr Rajiv Bahl, Secretary, Department of Health Research and DG, ICMR; Dr Sunita Sharma, Director General of Health Services (DGHS); Dr Rajeev Raghuvanshi, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI); and Dr Ranjan Das, Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nSenior health and drug control officials from all States and UTs, including Additional Chief Secretaries, Principal Secretaries, Drug Controllers, and NHM Mission Directors, also participated.\n\nKey Focus Areas\n\nThe discussions centred around three critical agenda points:\n \tCompliance with Schedule M and other GSR provisions relating to quality standards in drug manufacturing units;\n \tRational use of cough syrups in children, avoiding irrational combinations and inappropriate formulations; and\n \tStrengthening retail pharmacy regulation to prevent misuse and over-the-counter sales of such formulations.\n\nInvestigation Findings from Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh\n\nThe meeting follows reports of child deaths in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, allegedly linked to contaminated cough syrups. The Metropolitan Surveillance Unit (MSU), Nagpur, established under the Pradhan Mantri–Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM), had reported a cluster of cases and deaths from a block in Chhindwara district to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and the NCDC.\n\nTaking note of the reports, a Central expert team comprising epidemiologists, microbiologists, entomologists and drug inspectors from NCDC, National Institute of Virology (NIV) and Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) visited Chhindwara and Nagpur to investigate the situation in coordination with Madhya Pradesh authorities, said the statement.\n\nThe team collected clinical, environmental, entomological, and drug samples, which were sent to NIV Pune, Central Drug Laboratory (CDL) Mumbai, and NEERI Nagpur for analysis.\n\nPreliminary findings ruled out common infectious diseases, except for one positive case of Leptospirosis. Nineteen medicine samples consumed by affected children were collected from treating private practitioners and nearby retail outlets.\n\nChemical analysis of ten samples completed so far showed that nine met the required quality standards, while one cough syrup, “Coldrif,” contained diethylene glycol (DEG) beyond permissible limits.\n\nFollowing this finding, Tamil Nadu FDA—where the manufacturing unit is located in Kancheepuram—has initiated regulatory action, including cancellation of the manufacturing licence as recommended by CDSCO, and criminal proceedings have also been launched, the statement said.\n\nCentre’s Directive: Zero Tolerance for Non-Compliance\n\nUnion Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava emphasised strict adherence to the Revised Schedule M by all drug manufacturers. She directed States to undertake a thorough identification of non-compliant units and take strict punitive action where required.\n\nShe also urged States to ensure rational use of cough syrups, particularly in children, “as most coughs are self-limiting and do not require pharmacological treatment.” The advisory issued earlier by the DGHS on the rational use of cough syrups in paediatric populations was discussed during the meeting.\n\nSrivastava also stressed enhanced surveillance and early reporting:\n“States and UTs must ensure timely reporting by all health facilities, both government and private, and ensure wide dissemination of the community reporting tool of IDSP-IHIP. Inter-state coordination must be strengthened for early reporting and joint action,” she said.\n\nRisk-Based Inspections and GMP Upgradation\n\nThe Health Ministry informed that Risk-Based Inspections (RBI) have been initiated across 19 manufacturing units in six States to identify systemic gaps and strengthen quality assurance mechanisms.\n\nDr Rajeev Raghuvanshi, DCGI, reiterated the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to strictly comply with the revised GMP standards under Schedule M. He noted that certain firms applying for infrastructure upgradation under the government’s scheme have been granted an extension till December 2025, but urged States to ensure these norms are implemented without delay.\n\nThe Department of Pharmaceuticals informed that several drug units have already begun availing support under the Revamped Pharmaceuticals Technology Upgradation Assistance Scheme (RPTUAS) for GMP upgradation.\n\nExperts Warn Against Cough Syrup Overuse in Children\n\nDr Rajiv Bahl, Secretary, Department of Health Research and DG, ICMR, emphasised that children should not be prescribed cough syrups or any combination drugs to avoid side effects.\n\n“The National Joint Outbreak Response Team is already functional and ensures effective coordination between NCDC, ICMR and other central agencies. States must strengthen coordination between their own agencies for rapid response to any health emergency,” he said.\n\nDr Sunita Sharma, DGHS, underlined that cough medications provide minimal proven benefit in children but can pose significant risks.\n\n“We must check all formulations carefully to avoid combined overdoses and verify the concentration of active ingredients,” she said, adding that guidelines for doctors, pharmacists and parents on the rational use of paediatric cough syrups will soon be issued to States.\n\nState Updates\n\nSeveral States shared their updates and findings during the meeting.\n\nRajasthan’s Principal Secretary (Health) informed that investigations so far indicate the four child deaths reported were not linked to cough syrup quality, though awareness campaigns are being conducted on rational paediatric drug use. “By way of abundant caution, various regulatory actions have been taken and further investigations are underway,” the official said.\n\nAlso Read: Maharashtra FDA issues ‘stop use’ alert for Coldrif syrup batch linked to child deaths\n\nMaharashtra’s Secretary, Medical Education, reported that children admitted in Nagpur hospitals “are being treated with the best possible health care.”\n\nStates and UTs also apprised the Centre of their initiatives to strengthen drug quality control systems, enhance surveillance, and adopt best practices in pharmacovigilance and community awareness.\n\nCentre Reaffirms Commitment to Patient Safety\n\nConcluding the meeting, the Health Secretary reiterated the importance of enhanced surveillance, timely data sharing, and cross-border coordination among States.\n\nThe Ministry reaffirmed its zero-tolerance policy toward substandard drugs and its commitment to ensuring the highest standards of drug quality and patient safety.\n\n“Swift, coordinated, and sustained action is essential to prevent recurrence of such incidents,” the Ministry said in a statement.",

A number of Assamese community people living there and the singer had been on a yacht trip. He had gone to the Southeast Asian nation to attend the 4th edition of the North East India Festival, organised by Shyamkanu Mahanta and his company.\n\n”Our entire concern now is whether the people living in Singapore will come or not. If they do not come, we will not be able to complete the inquiry. They were the main people behind the yacht trip,” Sarma told reporters after meeting Garg’s family here on Saturday.\n\n”Assam Police cannot go to Singapore, so it cannot take up the investigation there. They (Assamese community people) are in Singapore, and it is not under my jurisdiction. Unless they come there, nobody will be able to join the dots,” he said.\n\nThe state CID, which is probing the death of the singer, had issued notices to some members of the Assam Association, Singapore, to present themselves before it by October 6.\n\n”Their parents stay in Assam. So, we, the people of Assam, must put pressure on the parents to ask their wards to come here for the probe,” the CM added.\n\nMore than 60 FIRs have been lodged across the state against Shyamkanu Mahanta, and around 10 others, including his manager Siddharth Sharma and band members Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and Amrit Prabha Mahanta.\n\nThese four individuals have already been arrested in the case and are serving 14 days of police remand each.\n\nSarma said, ”The people of Assam should put pressure on the Assamese community of Singapore so that those concerned are sent here. A few of them have already written to us that they cannot come due to some problems. But they have the responsibility as an Assamese.” To bring the people concerned through law is a different matter, but it will be sooner if there is public pressure on them, he added.\n\n”If they don’t come by October 6, we will have to enter another cycle,” Sarma said without elaborating.\n\nWhen asked about reports of Garg’s drummer Goswami’s claim before the police that the singer was poisoned, the CM said that many things will be spoken about during the course of the investigation.\n\n”On October 10, the viscera report will come. So, we will come to know on October 11 what actually happened. But the police’s duty is to note everything in the case diary.\n\nSarma stressed that the poisoning statement is not of the police, but of one accused.\n\n”Now, why has he made that statement? Is it to safeguard himself or to blame someone else — these things will be revealed during the investigation,” he added.\n\nThe Assam government on Friday set up a one-man judicial commission, headed by Justice Soumitra Saikia of the Gauhati High Court, to probe the death of Garg, a cultural icon of the state.\n\nThe chief minister said that the sitting high court judge will also have an opportunity to oversee the ongoing CID probe of the high-profile case.\n\n”It is a kind of body which will also take care of the proofs, and if they find that we are doing something wrong, the judicial commission will be able to be stricter on us. It will be a completely independent commission,” Sarma said.\n\nHe also asserted that in Assam, a sitting judge had never been entrusted with the responsibility of inquiring into an issue.",

One mill may have to contribute about ₹25 lakh to the CMRF. We are seeking funds from the profits of sugar mills, not from farmers.\" He slammed those criticising the decision, saying they were misinterpreting it.\n\"Some people have stooped so low that they are portraying this as the government taking money from farmers.

The NIA took over the probe a few days later, on April 12.\n\nSidhu, an operative of the proscribed terrorist organisation Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), along with his associate Manish, formed a terror gang to target prominent leaders of Punjab to create a climate of fear among the people and raise funds for the BKI through extortion, a statement issued by the NIA said.\n\nManish had subsequently recruited Ameen, who had hurled the grenade at the former minister’s house, it said. The grenade was supplied to Ameen by Sidhu, while Jangra provided the funds, the probe agency said.\n\nSidhu had circulated a poster after the attack, claiming responsibility for hatching the conspiracy along with Manish, it said.\n\nA red corner notice has been issued against Sidhu, who is also carrying a reward of ₹10 lakh on his arrest.\n\nThe NIA had earlier chargesheeted Sidhu in a case related to the targeted killing of Punjab-based VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) leader Vikas Prabhakar in April 2024.\n\nThe anti-terror agency has intensified its efforts to track and arrest the absconders and identify other members of BKI operating in India, the statement said.",

Those users who opt for Unified Payment Interface (UPI) will have to pay 1.25 times the applicable fee depending on the category of the vehicle.\n\nAlso read | No need for electric vehicles to pay toll on these three major express roads in Maharashtra\n\nFor example, if a vehicle with a valid FASTag pays ₹100 as user fee at a toll plaza, those without a functional FASTag will need to pay ₹200 if they are making the payment via cash. If they use UPI, the amount to be paid will be ₹125.\n\nImpact of the move\n\nThe amended rule is expected to expedite the fee collection process on national highways, promote ease of commuting and improve transparency in toll collection. Earlier, both UPI and cash users without a valid FASTag had to pay double the applicable user fee. The change in the rules would lead to faster travel time at toll plazas and shorter queues, as per reports. It would encourage more travellers to opt for FASTags as that remains the cheapest option for toll collection.\n\nAlso read | FASTag toll collection jumps 19.6% to ₹20,681 crore in Q1; users up 16.2%\n\nStarting November 15, UPI will be an attractive payment option for non-FASTag users, given that it will be cheaper than paying cash and would incentivise digital payments with the government's policies to adopt technology.(Edited by : Jerome Anthony)",

Only 54 students were enrolled in IGP and other courses.\n\nThis deliberate concealment of important information misled aspirants and parents into believing that Drishti IAS was responsible for their success in all stages of the UPSC examination, which is a misleading advertisement under Section 2(28) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nCCPA also noted that this is the second penalty imposed on Drishti IAS for similar conduct. Earlier, in September 2024, the authority had passed a final order against Drishti IAS for its misleading claim of ”150+ selections in UPSC CSE 2021”.\n\nThe institute submitted the details of 161 candidates, exceeding its claim of 150+ selections in UPSC CSE 2021.\n\nIn that case too, it was found that out of these 161 candidates, 148 were enrolled in IGP, seven were enrolled in Mains Mentorship Program, four were enrolled in GS Foundation Program, one in Optional course and the details of the remaining one candidate were not mentioned.\n\nThe CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹3 lakh and directed the discontinuation of the misleading advertisement.\n\nDespite being penalised and cautioned earlier, Drishti IAS once again indulged in the same practice for the 2022 examination results by enhancing its claim to ”216+ selections”, thereby showing repeated non-compliance and disregard for consumer protection norms.\n\nThe concealment of such crucial information deprived prospective students and parents of their right to make an informed choice, as per Section 2(9) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\n”Such advertisements create false expectations and unfairly influence consumer decisions, particularly when large claims are made without transparent disclosure of facts,” the ministry said.\n\nSo far, the CCPA has issued 54 notices to various coaching institutes for misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices. Penalties amounting to over ₹90.6 lakh have been imposed on 26 coaching institutes, along with directions to discontinue such misleading claims.\n\nThe CCPA noted that all such institutes concealed important information regarding the courses opted for by successful candidates in their advertisements, which amounts to misleading advertisements under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThe authority has emphasised that all coaching institutes must strictly ensure truthful disclosure of information in their advertisements so that students can make fair and informed decisions regarding their academic choices.",

Krishnan: New online gaming rules bring clarity, authority to be operational from day oneThe draft online gaming rules aim to bring clarity for industry players while safeguarding users, MeitY Secretary S. Krishnan said. Registration is mandatory for e-sports but voluntary for social games, with banks allowed to return user funds. He added that the new Online Gaming Authority will be active from day one, while the ECM scheme has drawn overwhelming industry response.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has released draft rules for online gaming, aimed at bringing regulatory clarity while supporting innovation in the sector. In an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18, MeitY Secretary S. Krishnan explained key provisions, stressing that the framework is designed to safeguard users while enabling ease of doing business for developers.On the release of the draft online gaming rules\nKrishnan dismissed the idea of a staggered rollout, noting that the legislation was passed swiftly in Parliament and the rules were framed after extensive consultation with industry.\n“Most of the industry has accepted the spirit of the law and stopped offering many of the money games defined under it. The rules are fairly straightforward, and we want to give the industry enough time to respond,” he said.\nOn registration requirements\nHe clarified that registration is not mandatory for online social games.\n“Registration of an online social game is voluntary. This is a major ease of doing business step for startups and innovators, ensuring that small or educational games don’t face regulatory burden,” Krishnan added. By contrast, e-sports will require registration under the new framework.\nOn enabling banks to return user deposits\nAddressing industry concerns on refunds, Krishnan said the Act was not designed to penalise players.\n“The intent is to treat them more as victims. That’s why clarity has been provided to banks that they can return deposits or money collected without violating the law,” he noted.\nOn subscription vs reward models\nWhile subscription-based revenue is permissible, reward-based models will require closer scrutiny.\n“The subscription system is clearly covered in the Act. Reward systems will have to be examined, case by case, by the authority, depending on their nature,” he said.\nOn Online Gaming Authority\nKrishnan emphasised that the proposed authority will be ready to function immediately.\n“We’ve kept it lean and digital so it can be operational from day one of the rules being notified. Officials are in place, and the system will be ready to launch quickly,” he said.\nOn the Component Scheme response\nThe Secretary also highlighted the overwhelming industry response to the Electronics Component Manufacturing (ECM) scheme, with proposals worth ₹1.15 lakh crore—double the government’s initial expectations. However, he cautioned that there was no fixed timeline for approvals.\n“We don’t want to rush the technical teams. The priority is ensuring quality implementation,” Krishnan stressed.\nOn technology transfer under the Component Scheme\nHe underlined that foreign companies applying under joint ventures would be expected to transfer technology to Indian entities.\n“This is embedded in the scheme’s spirit. We’re moving step by step—from assembly to local manufacturing and then to design. India has one of the best STEM talent pools in the world, and that makes it a natural design hub,” he said.(Edited by : Ajay Vaishnav)",

Chandrababu Naidu will launch a new welfare programme titled 'Auto Driverla Sevalo' on October 4. The scheme will provide annual financial assistance of ₹15,000 to 2,90,234 autorickshaw, taxi and maxi cab drivers across the state. The launch will take place in the Vijayawada Central constituency.\n\nThe government has allocated about ₹435 crore for the scheme. The financial aid will be deposited directly into the bank accounts of eligible drivers.\n\nEarlier, under the Vahana Mitra scheme, drivers received ₹12,000 per year. The new programme increases this amount, and both existing Vahana Mitra beneficiaries and new applicants will be included.\n\nAccording to officials, the scheme was announced on September 12 and was initially planned for Dasara but was later rescheduled to October 4. It is intended to help drivers whose incomes have fallen since the government launched the Stree Shakti scheme, which has been providing free bus travel for women since August 15, Independence Day.\n\nEligibility is restricted to permanent residents of Andhra Pradesh who own and drive passenger vehicles such as autorickshaws, taxis or maxi cabs. Applicants must have a valid driving licence, Aadhaar card, ration card and vehicle registration certificate. Drivers operating rented vehicles are not eligible.\n\nThe government has released the beneficiary list on September 24. Drivers can check their eligibility online through the GSWS-NBM portal using their Aadhaar details or offline by visiting Gram Secretariats in rural areas and Ward Secretariats in urban areas.\n\nBesides this initiative, the state government has also reduced green tax on older vehicles and invested in road development to support drivers. Naidu said the programme was not part of the NDA’s original manifesto but has been introduced to address the difficulties caused by Stree Shakti.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the Assembly, the Chief Minister said the NDA coalition, with support from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan, is in a position to expand welfare schemes and increase financial aid compared to the previous government.\n\nHe added that the government is also working on lowering electricity charges, completing irrigation projects worth ₹2,000 crore in North Andhra, finishing six lakh houses by June 2026, and speeding up work on the Bhogapuram international airport, expected to open in August 2026.\n\nIn recent meetings, Naidu highlighted that the state is spending ₹2,745 crore every month on pensions, benefitting 63.5 lakh people, and has disbursed a total of ₹48,019 crore in pensions over the last 16 months. He also said the Stree Shakti scheme has enabled 8.86 crore free bus rides by women in 45 days, with the government spending ₹247 crore per month on it.\n\nNaidu further noted that the state has attracted investments worth ₹10 lakh crore, creating nine lakh jobs, with 4.7 lakh people already employed in the last 15 months. He also promised to continue support for farmers under Annadata Sukheebhava, expand housing programmes, and promote women’s entrepreneurship through DWCRA groups.(Edited by : Vivek Dubey)",

We had aimed to strike their bases. We have no complaints against ordinary Pakistani citizens, so long as their country does not sponsor terrorists.

He said Pakistan also lost radars, command and control centres, runways and hangars.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday, Singh said that the air force has drawn Roadmap 2047 to enhance its combat capabilities, highlighting the need to look for newer aircraft and replace older ones.\nAlso Read: PM Modi to unveil youth-focused initiatives worth over ₹62,000 crore on October 4\n(Edited by : Ajay Vaishnav)",

Symptoms can include high fever and severe joint pain, and about 50% of the patients are said to suffer from long-term joint pain and disability.\n\nWhile there are no specific treatments for the viral mosquito-borne infection, two preventive vaccines have been approved for use in certain countries, including the US.\n\nThe study is the first of its kind to predict chikungunya burden by combining existing data on chikungunya infections with factors that may influence the likelihood of infections, the authors said.\n\nPrevious estimates that often looked at surveillance and outbreak reports could likely be an underestimate, they added.\n\nAlso Read: Rains likely in parts of UP, Bihar; showers predicted in Delhi-NCR\n\nEstimates presented in the study could be useful for prioritising regions and targeting vulnerable age groups — children under 10, adults aged 80 and over — for introducing chikungunya vaccine, the team said.\n\nThey estimated \"global chikungunya burden annually of 14.4 million (1.44 crore) infections\" and \"India and Brazil accounted for 48% of the global burden\".\n\n\"The chronic phase accounts for 54% of chikungunya burden, with relatively higher burden among 40-60-year-old population, with mortality disproportionately affecting children under 10 and adults over 80,” the team added.\n\nLead researcher Hyolim Kang, also a research fellow at Nagasaki University, \"It’s been widely thought that mosquitoes carrying chikungunya would be confined to subtropical or tropical continents, but our analysis has found that the risk extends way beyond these regions.\" \"Prevention of the spread of this disease is important for everyone.\n\nThere are no specific antiviral therapies for chikungunya and treatment relies solely on supportive care. Not only are infections extremely painful, even the healthiest of people can be infected and left with life-long disability,” Kang said.",

Dubbed Exercise Gandiva, this operation involves realistic drills designed to test and enhance the country’s crisis response capabilities.\n\nThe drills are being conducted across various regions and simulate a wide range of terrorist threats. These include complex scenarios involving hostage rescues, bomb threats, armed intrusions, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNe) situations. The goal is to rehearse modern tactics and refine operational responses.\nThe most significant phase of the exercise took place on the nights of October 3 and 4, when the NSG executed simultaneous, high-intensity counter-terror drills in Varanasi, Chittorgarh, Pune, and Jammu. These unprecedented operations, overseen by senior officials from the NSG and the Ministry of Home Affairs, showcased the force's ability to respond swiftly and effectively to coordinated attacks in multiple locations.\n\nKey scenarios during Exercise Gandiva included:\n \tCounter-terror and hostage rescue missions at public places, religious and sensitive locations, and river cruise vessels.\n \tDetection and defusing of bomb and IED threats.\n \tNeutralising armed intrusions at both public and private facilities.\n \tResponse protocols for CBRNe incidents.\n\nExercise Gandiva is part of the NSG’s annual training calendar and is conducted in coordination with State Police Forces, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), Airport and Waterways Authorities, and local administrations. The exercise not only tested rapid deployment capabilities but also highlighted seamless inter-agency coordination and the country's readiness to tackle evolving terrorist threats.\n\nThrough these drills, the NSG demonstrated how even the most challenging operations can be executed successfully with precise planning, coordination, and execution.",

CCPA found that the claim was misleading and concealed crucial information regarding the type and duration of courses opted for by these candidates.The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a penalty of ₹5 lakhs on Drishti IAS (VDK Eduventures Pvt. Ltd.) for publishing misleading advertisements over the results of the UPSC Civil Services Examination (CSE) 2022.\n\nDrishti IAS, in its advertisement, prominently claimed \"216+ selections in UPSC CSE 2022\" along with names and photographs of successful candidates. However, upon examination, CCPA found that the claim was misleading and concealed crucial information regarding the type and duration of courses opted for by these candidates.\n\nThe investigation revealed that out of the 216 candidates claimed by Drishti IAS, as many as 162 candidates (75%) had only taken the free Interview Guidance Programme (IGP) of the Institute, after independently clearing the Preliminary and Mains stages of UPSC CSE. Only 54 students were enrolled in IGP+ and other courses.\n\nThe authorities stated that Drishti IAS deliberately concealed important information, misleading aspirants and parents into believing the institute was responsible for their success in all stages of the UPSC examination. This act qualifies as a misleading advertisement under Section 2(28) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nCCPA noted that this is the second penalty imposed on Drishti IAS for similar conduct. Earlier, in September 2024, the Authority had passed a final order against the institute for its misleading claim of \"150+ selections in UPSC CSE 2021\". The institute submitted the details of 161 candidates against its claim of 150+ selections in UPSC CSE 2021. Therein, as well, out of the total candidates, 148 were enrolled in IGP, seven were enrolled in the Mains Mentorship Program, four were enrolled in the GS Foundation Program, and one was enrolled in an Optional course. The details of the remaining candidate were not mentioned. CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹ 3 lakh and directed to discontinue the misleading advertisement.\n\nThe order noted that despite being penalised and cautioned earlier, Drishti IAS once again indulged in the same practice for the 2022 examination results by enhancing its claim to \"216+ selections\". It added that the concealment of such crucial information deprived prospective students and parents of their right to make an informed choice under Section 2(9) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, indicating that such advertisements create false expectations and unfairly influence consumer decisions, particularly when large claims are made without transparent disclosure of facts.\n\nSo far, the CCPA has issued 54 notices to various coaching institutes for misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices. Penalties amounting to over ₹ 90.6 lakh have been imposed on 26 coaching institutes, along with directions to discontinue such misleading claims. CCPA noted that all such institutes concealed important information regarding courses opted by successful candidates in their advertisement, which amounts to misleading advertisement under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThe Authority has emphasised that all coaching institutes must strictly ensure truthful disclosure of information in their advertisements so that students can make fair and informed decisions regarding their academic choices.",

He said Pakistan's losses included radars, command and control centres, runways and hangars.\n\nThe Air Chief said, \"As far as Pakistan's losses are concerned, we have struck a large number of their airfields and we struck a large number of installations. Because of these strikes, radars at least four places, command and control centres at two places, runways of course damaged at two places, then three of their hangars in three different stations have been damaged.

It has now increased to 83, officials said on Friday, citing the study conducted during the past year.\n\nThe survey also involved strong community participation, indicating that the long-term conservation plans with community involvement are bearing results, they added.\n\nThe new survey released on Thursday (the first day of the Wildlife Week being observed from October 2 to 8) said the count excluded cubs and exceeded the estimated upper confidence limit of 73 over the 2021 survey, reflecting possible expansion of habitats.\nThe survey was conducted through a large-scale camera trapping exercise across six sites over an area of 26,000 sq km. The snow leopards and their habitats were detected in the tribal areas of Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur and the Pangi valley.\n\nHowever, the study also recorded their presence beyond the protected areas, which comprise the Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary, Great Himalayan National Park, Sechu Tuan Nallah Wildlife Sanctuary and Asrang Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nIn addition to snow leopards, the survey also drew distribution maps for key prey species such as the blue sheep, Himalayan ibex and musk deer, as well as other high-altitude mammals such as Himalayan wolves, brown bears, leopards, red foxes, and martens.\n\nNotably, the study reported the first official sighting of Pallas's cat in Kinnaur and the rediscovery of the woolly flying squirrel in Lahaul, highlighting the rich biodiversity of the state.\n\nAccording to the officials, community involvement was key to the survey's success. Local youths and women from Kibber village in Spiti assisted with camera trap deployments and data analysis, while frontline forest officers and other community members supported field operations.

It departed from the newly inaugurated in-plant railway siding at Maruti Suzuki’s Manesar facility and covered more than 850 kilometres to reach the Anantnag railway terminal in Jammu \u0026 Kashmir.\n\nOn the way, the train crossed the Chenab river on the world’s highest railway arch bridge, inaugurated earlier this year under the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link project.\n\nUnion Minister for Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “In recent times, apples from the valley have been transported using the Jammu \u0026 Kashmir rail link. Now, Maruti Suzuki cars will be transported to Kashmir valley by rail. Jammu – Srinagar railway line is a game changer for the people of Jammu \u0026 Kashmir.” Flag off of the first batch of over 100 Maruti Suzuki vehicles sent via rail for Anantnag from Manesar in-plant railway siding.\n\nMaruti Suzuki’s Managing Director \u0026 CEO, Hisashi Takeuchi, said, “Railway dispatches are central to our logistics strategy. The world’s highest railway arch bridge over Chenab river is one such landmark, enabling seamless and efficient connectivity to Kashmir valley and allowing Maruti Suzuki to better serve customers in the region.”\n\nHe added that the company operates in-plant railway sidings at both Manesar and Gujarat under the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, enabling direct dispatches from its production facilities.\n\nThe announcement coincides with a surge in demand during the festive season. Maruti Suzuki delivered 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days of Navratri and expects the figure to cross 2 lakh by the end of the nine-day festival. The company reported 3.5 lakh bookings during this period, with nearly 2.5 lakh still pending.\n\nPartho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer, Marketing \u0026 Sales, said, “It is all because of the initiative taken by our Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on GST rate cut that the industry is witnessing strong growth.”\n\nIn September 2025, Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales fell 8.3 percent year-on-year to 1,35,711 units, down from 1,48,061 in September 2024. However, exports hit a record 42,204 units, a 52.2 percent increase from last year, taking total sales to 1,89,665 units, up 2.7 percent year-on-year. The company has crossed 2.1 lakh units in exports in the first half of the financial year.\n\nSegment-wise, compact cars recorded growth with 66,882 units sold compared to 60,480 in September 2024. Utility vehicles declined to 48,695 units from 61,549 despite demand for Brezza, Ertiga, Fronx, Grand Vitara, and the newly launched Victoris, mainly due to competition.",

    "title": "Eat less meat is still the message from flagship diet report",
    "content": "When a group of leading scientists and nutrition experts unveiled a global diet plan several years ago, few expected it to ignite one of the fiercest food debates in recent memory. Their central prescription seemed innocuous: For an increasingly populous planet to thrive, wealthy nations should eat less meat and more plants.\n\nBut soon after publication, the report from the EAT-Lancet Commission became a lightning rod. The authors were subjected to threats, accused of elitism and targeted in social media campaigns backed by the meat industry. Some policymakers embraced its recommendations, while others, particularly in the US, dismissed it as a “woke” attempt to take away meat from people’s plates.\n\nRound two of that debate has now arrived. Pulling from fresh data and input from experts in more than 30 countries, the commission released a second version of its report on Friday, doubling down on largely the same message: Eat less meat, and more beans, nuts and vegetables — especially if you live in the rich world. The shift could prevent about 15 million premature deaths a year globally and cut farm emissions by 15%.\n\n“By improving diets, we would improve the environment,” said Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University and co-chair of the commission. “There’s an element of urgency here that has only grown since the last time.”\n\nAlso Read: E-commerce, processed foods top sectors for GST-related consumer complaints: Consumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare\n\nFood systems account for about a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, driven largely by animal farming, which is a major source of methane and a drain on land and water resources. Even if the world transitions away from fossil fuels, food alone could push temperatures past the 1.5°C threshold needed to limit warming. The onus falls disproportionately on the wealthy: The richest 30% of the world’s population are responsible for more than 70% of food-related pressures, the report said.\n\nThe commission’s so-called “planetary health diet” resembles the Mediterranean diet and other traditional ones around the world, with recommendations presented as ranges that allow flexibility, according to Willett. It’s not pushing veganism, but simply supporting the idea that animal-sourced foods should be optional, moderate and guided by a “1+1” principle: one dairy serving and one other animal protein source daily. “It allows for cultural diversity and individual preferences,” Willett said.\n\nThe biggest changes will hit the meat and dairy industries. Production of beef, goat and lamb must fall by one-third from 2020 levels through 2050, the report says, and global herds of cattle and other ruminants have to shrink by about a quarter. Still, the report makes clear that diet change alone won’t be enough. Reducing food waste and increasing agricultural productivity are also crucial.\n\nThe updated commission report, dubbed EAT-Lancet 2.0, was prepared by a panel that included experts in livestock, economics, nutrition and climate. It underwent peer review and was funded by organisations including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\nAlso Read: Tata Consumer signs MoU with food ministry for ₹2,000 cr investment over 5 years\n\nThe first version was widely cited after its publication in 2019, appearing in more than 600 policy documents. Cities such as Milan, London and Tokyo pledged to align public food procurement with its recommendations. Policymakers saw it as a “go-to” guide for integrating sustainability into dietary guidelines, said Tim Benton, professor at the University of Leeds and a food security expert.\n\nYet its rollout has been limited. Global meat consumption is still climbing, and alternative protein sales are faltering. The pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and soaring food prices have eroded political and consumer appetite for sustainability. Meanwhile, the political climate has shifted with the rise of right-wing populism. The manosphere and MAGA-influenced machismo have fueled the popularity of the carnivore diet.\n\n“The political power of the livestock sector and then this kind of right-wing populism that ‘no one’s gonna tell me that I can’t eat meat ’— all of those things come together to mean that the EAT-Lancet was quite a juicy target for what we now would call the anti-woke agenda,” Benton said.\n\nFor some of the report’s leading figures, the backlash has been deeply personal.\n\nGunhild Stordalen, the physician who co-founded the EAT Foundation and coordinated funding for the report, was cast online as part of a “Davos elite.” An investigation later found evidence of orchestrated efforts to discredit the study. Critical social media posts, amplified by a network of “misinfluencers” with ties to the livestock industry, used the hashtag #yes2meat, according to the nonprofit Changing Markets Foundation, which warned last week of a fresh campaign against the update.\n\nThe new report attempts to answer some earlier criticism, including claims that its focus was too Western and ignored local diets or affordability. This time, the emphasis is on “just” food systems: Almost half of the world’s population does not have access to affordable, healthy diets, fair wages and safe environments.\n\nThe commission says that while the Global North must cut back sharply, parts of the Global South may need to increase animal protein intake to address malnutrition — though not to the levels seen in wealthy countries.\n\nDelivering those changes, the report argues, will require new policies, from subsidy reforms to taxes, to ensure that healthy food is affordable and accessible. Stordalen said the commission will take the updated report on a global roadshow to highlight its impact in different regions and cultures. It’s also set to host dialogues with anyone from farmers and chefs to consumers and doctors.\n\n“We are bringing all key stakeholders to the table to have conversations, brave conversations, and really trying to change mindsets,” she said.\n\nTrack live stock market updates on CNBC-TV18.com",

Police have been asked to be vigilant at Ramleela grounds, Durga Puja fairs and Ravan Dahan programmes, which draw a massive footfall.\n\n”All district magistrates, deputy collectors, police and administrative officials must discharge their responsibilities seriously. Any lapse will invite stern action,” Chaudhary said.\n\nOfficials said intelligence agencies have also been put on alert and teams deployed in the field.\n\n”Armed police forces are being positioned at sensitive locations. We are ensuring foolproof arrangements so that the disturbances witnessed in Bareilly do not spill over to neighbouring districts,” an official said.\n\nOn September 26, there was a confrontation between police and about 2,000 people who had gathered outside a mosque in the Kotwali area in Bareilly after Friday prayers. Stone-pelting was also reported.\n\nThe unrest was triggered by the cancellation of a protest over the ”I Love Muhammad” poster row called by cleric Tauqeer Khan.\n\nTill Wednesday, 81 people were arrested in connection with the September 26 violence.",

This would provide employment to millions of people and bring light into their lives,” the minister said.\nShah, who is also the Cooperation Minister, said Mahatma Gandhi was the one who recognised the soul of India and awoke the common people of the country to stand up against the British.\n\nHe said Mahatma Gandhi wove many such things into the freedom movement from which the map of future India was framed.\n\nThe home minister said two big ideas emerged from those things — Khadi and ’swadeshi’.\n\n”We cannot separate the freedom movement from Khadi and swadeshi,” he said, adding that by giving these ideas to the country, Mahatma Gandhi not only gave momentum to the freedom movement but also enlightened the lives of many poor people in the country.\n\nShah said that for a very long time, both the ideas of Khadi and ’swadeshi’ were forgotten.\n\nReferring to a major campaign he launched in 2003 in Gujarat for the revival of Khadi, when Modi was the Gujarat chief minister, Shah said Khadi has again become a thing of use for the general public and the direct proof of this is the manifold increase in the use and purchase of Khadi products since 2014.\n\nThe turnover of Khadi Gramodyog has reached ₹1,70,000 crore, which is a great achievement, he said.\n\nShah also appealed to people to strengthen the two campaigns — the use of Khadi and the adoption of ’swadeshi’.\n\n”We should make these a part of our nature and pass on both these campaigns to our next generations,” he said.",

These were heated and mixed, with chemical-based flavouring agents, colours and unsafe additives used to give the mixture the texture and taste of pure desi ghee.\n\nThe product was then packed in tins resembling popular brands and supplied to dairies and shops, particularly during the festive season.\n\n\"Each tin of duplicate ghee costs them around ₹1,300 to ₹1,400 to produce, and they sold it for ₹3,500 to ₹4,000 in the market,\" a senior police officer said.\n\nDuring the raids, police said Safiq was found running a unit in Karawal Nagar with 520 kg of spurious ghee. In another raid, four accused, including Malik and his son, were apprehended from Shiv Vihar with 440 kg of spurious ghee. In Mustafabad, Zamaluddin was arrested with 665 kg of adulterated ghee.\n\nA case has been registered under the relevant provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the Food Safety and Standards Act. Further investigation is underway to trace the wider supply chain and identify others involved, police said.\n\nPolice said some of them were habitual offenders who had been booked earlier for similar crimes.\n\nALSO READ | 9 simple ways to check the purity of ghee at home",

    "title": "Can babies really grow from skin cells? Scientists report a breakthrough",
    "content": "Scientists in Oregon have successfully created human eggs from adult skin cells, marking a major step forward in reproductive science. The breakthrough could one day help infertile women and same-sex couples conceive, though it raises complex ethical and legal questions.adult skin cells. The research, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for new options for women struggling with infertility and even same-sex couples. However, it also raises a host of ethical and legal concerns.\n\n\"It's a significant step forward,\" said Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health \u0026 Science University, who led the team behind the breakthrough.\n\nFor years, scientists have attempted to create human eggs in the lab using the genetic material of people unable to conceive naturally. The field, known as in vitro gametogenesis, has seen labs in the US, Japan and elsewhere racing to find viable solutions. Until now, the most promising results produced only primitive, non-viable egg-like cells.\n\nMitalipov’s team took a different route. Instead of reprogramming cells into stem cells — the path most researchers have pursued — his group used the same cloning technique once employed to create Dolly the sheep. They removed most of the DNA from a donor egg and replaced it with DNA from a woman’s skin cell, then pushed the reconstituted cell through a new process they call “mitomeiosis.”\n\nThe experiment produced 82 functional eggs.\nTo evaluate them, the eggs were fertilized with sperm. Some reached the blastocyst stage — the point at which embryos are typically considered for implantation. None, however, were suitable for transfer. All the embryos showed genetic abnormalities that would prevent normal development.\n\nEven so, experts say the progress is notable. \"I think it's a very significant step in terms of moving forward to the ability to use skin cells to make egg cells for human reproduction at some point in the future, once we can prove this is safe and effective,\" said Dr. Sigal Klipstein of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, speaking to NPR.\n\nIf successful in the long term, the technology could allow infertile women to have children genetically related to them. It could also make it possible for two men to have a biological child together — using skin cells from one partner to create an egg and fertilizing it with sperm from the other. \"The implications are huge,\" Mitalipov said.\n\nAccording to NPR, some scientists are skeptical that the process will ever fully work. Amander Clark, a developmental biologist at UCLA, noted that the technique skips a critical step in normal egg development. \"It is unclear whether skipping meiosis in half the genome is compatible with human development,\" she said.\n\nBeyond the science, ethical debates are already intensifying. Critics worry about scenarios that sound like science fiction but are technically possible — from “designer babies” to the misuse of stolen DNA. \"We could have Taylor Swift babies all over the world,\" said Ronald Green, a Dartmouth College bioethicist. \"It's a theoretical possibility, but not crazy.\"\n\nOthers have raised the idea of a so-called “uni-baby,” a child created using only one person’s DNA. \"Would anyone want to do that? Well, there are 8 billion people in the world… I wouldn’t guarantee that no one would want to do that,\" said Stanford’s Hank Greely, who has written extensively about reproductive ethics, according to NPR.\n\nFor now, the embryos remain far from viable, and years of research lie ahead before the technology could move into human trials. Still, if safety concerns can be addressed, scientists believe it could transform the future of reproduction for millions worldwide.",
