The brokerage firm highlights the bank’s robust management, consistent market share gains, and resilient underwriting through credit cycles.

    "title": "From assets to investments: Making infrastructure and real estate as investible as equities",
    "content": "For years, Indian investors focused mainly on Gold and Real Estate. In the last couple of decades, exposure to stocks and mutual funds has been increasing. There were limited opportunities to invest directly in infrastructure and Real Estate. But today, a new wave is changing the game for infrastructure and real estate just as accessible and investible as equities. This opportunity is not just financial innovation but a structural leap toward inclusive and sustainable investing, where every Indian investor from a young professional to a pension fund can participate in building the physical backbone of the country.The Rise of Real Assets as an Investible Class‘Investible’ means you can put your money into something and expect returns like buying shares of a company. Until recently, infrastructure like roads, power plants, transmission lines, warehouses and real estate like commercial buildings and malls were out of reach for most Indian investors due to large capital requirements and deep expertise required. However, global institutions and investors have been investing in Real Assets globally and in India over many decades.That changed with the advent of AIFs (Alternative Investment Funds), InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) and REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts). Now, these sectors are open to Indian investorAIFs, particularly those focused on infrastructure, real estate, and yield assets, offer investors the flexibility of participating in private-market opportunities not available through listed instruments.InvITs allow investors to earn income from operational infrastructure assets such as toll roads, annuity roads, transmission grids, renewable energy, warehousing, telecom towers, etc.REITs provide exposure to income-generating real estate like office spaces, malls, and industrial parks earning returns through rent and capital appreciation.All three are regulated, professionally managed, and yield-oriented, enabling investors to access stable, inflation-hedged returns once limited to large institutions.Why This Matters: From Physical to Financial AssetsThis movement represents India’s asset financialization, the conversion of physical, cash-generating assets into liquid investment opportunities.For investors, this delivers:Stable, predictable cash flows from long-term contracts, rents, and tariffs.Inflation-hedged, real returns, uncorrelated to short-term equity market volatility.Diversification across infrastructure, real estate, and private yield assets.Access and inclusivity, allowing retail and institutional investors alike to participate with modest investments.For the nation, this democratization channels domestic savings into productive, growth-driving assets funding India’s roads, power grids, renewable energy, logistics parks, and commercial infrastructure.Growth and Scale of InvIT \u0026 REITs Market Over the past few years, India has seen a remarkable rise in the popularity and scale of REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts). As of FY25, the combined Assets Under Management (AUM) of these instruments has reached USD 93.9 billion, more than doubling from USD 42.1 billion in FY20. This growth reflects increasing investor confidence and the maturity of these asset classes.InvITs alone account for a significant portion of this, with an AUM of USD 73 billion in FY25. Looking ahead, the InvIT market is projected to grow substantially, with estimates suggesting it could reach USD 258 billion by 2030. This signals a strong future for infrastructure investment through capital markets.Currently, India has 5 listed REITs and 26 listed InvITs, offering investors a range of options to participate in income-generating assets. Together, these trusts have a combined market capitalization of USD 33.2 billion, making them a substantial part of India’s financial ecosystem.AIFs: The Bridge Between Private and Public MarketsAIFs complement REITs and InvITs by offering customized structures that can fund early-stage projects, aggregate assets to developers, or acquire pre-operational assets before they mature into listed trusts.They play a crucial bridge role by channeling private capital into infrastructure and real estate well before those assets are ready for public-market. This ensures a continuous capital flow across the life cycle of real assets from creation to monetization.AIFs, too, have seen unprecedented growth with the total AUM crossing INR 10 lakh crore (USD 120 billion) reflecting a broad investor shift towards alternatives and yield-driven assets.As regulatory clarity deepens and performance histories lengthen, AIFs, InvITs, and REITs will collectively form a seamless ecosystem of real-asset investing, much like equities and mutual funds do today.Choosing the Right Platform: The Role of Asset ManagersWhile the opportunity is large, the quality of the platform managing these assets determines long-term success. Investors should evaluate onTrack record and governance of the asset managerTransparency and disclosure in operations and reportingTechnology adoption in monitoring and asset optimizationESG integration and sustainability performanceGrowth pipeline—visibility on future acquisitions that can expand the trust or fund’s AUMThe best managers today combine infrastructure operations expertise with institutional-grade risk management and transparency, ensuring investors participate not just in returns, but in responsible nation-building.India’s Next Leap: Financializing GrowthWith government infrastructure spending having risen from USD 12 billion in FY15 to USD 75 billion in FY25, the demand for capital will only multiply. Public resources alone cannot meet this scale.The next phase of India’s growth must therefore be capital-market led, where citizens, institutions, and global investors co-own India’s growth story through investible infrastructure and real estate assets.Every toll road, solar park, warehouse, and office tower is now a potential investment instrument, not just a physical structure. The convergence of AIFs, InvITs, and REITs is reshaping how wealth is created, risks are managed, and infrastructure is financed.This is not merely a shift in portfolio composition but a mindset transformation. The future of investing lies not in abstraction, but in ownership of the very assets that power India’s roads, cities, and industries.Infrastructure and real estate are no longer distant, illiquid domains, they are now as investible as equities. For investors and for India alike, that is the next great leap.(The author is CEO – EAAA Alternatives)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "content": "Ananth Narayan, who led a high-profile probe into Jane Street Group LLC as a senior official at India’s securities regulator, will hand over the investigation as his three-year term ends on Thursday.The former trader’s scheduled departure as a member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s board comes as the regulator faces the US proprietary trading firm in the nation’s appeal court. Narayan, the only person on SEBI’s board with a trading background, was thrust into the spotlight in July after signing an order that accused the US trading giant of manipulating India’s stock and derivatives markets — often at the expense of millions of retail investors.Narayan, who has spent more than two decades at global banks including Standard Chartered Plc, has been a driving force behind the charges against Jane Street, with a team comprising officers from the regulator’s surveillance and derivatives departments. SEBI is confident the team will see the probe through even after his departure, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.The case, one of the largest ever brought by SEBI against an overseas firm, has captured global attention. It pits the regulator of the world’s largest equity options market by contracts against one of Wall Street’s most profitable traders. The dispute also stoked fears that SEBI could further tighten rules, following curbs introduced late last year to damp retail speculation. The Indian government, which appoints members to SEBI, had sought applications for the post through Oct. 6, according to a notification issued last month on the website of the Department of Economic Affairs.In addition to market supervision, Narayan is also responsible for departments including enforcement and foreign portfolio investors, according to the regulator’s website.In its July order, the market regulator accused Jane Street of using its “immense trading, financial and technological prowess” to manipulate markets, particularly index options on expiry days. The findings mainly focused on trades in cash and derivatives involving Indian bank stocks and the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.’s index tracking the sector. Jane Street has denied the allegations and pledged to fight them.The firm deposited 48.4 billion rupees ($545 million) in an escrow account to comply with the July ruling, which prompted the regulator to lift a temporary trading ban.Jane Street, which pulled in a record $10.1 billion in net trading revenue in the second quarter, has accused the regulator of withholding documents crucial to its defense and asked the court for a pause in legal proceedings till its appeal is heard.At a Sept. 9 hearing, Jane Street told the Securities Appellate Tribunal that it had not resumed trading in India since the July order. The tribunal is now set to hear the case on Nov. 18 and directed SEBI to defend itself through a written reply.",

    "title": "Explained: Reliance Industries is India’s most valuable company but why isn’t it No.1 in Nifty50 weight?",
    "content": "SynopsisReliance Industries, despite its massive market capitalization, ranks third in Nifty 50 index weight due to its lower free-float shares. Banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank hold higher weights because a larger portion of their stock is available for public trading, influencing the index more significantly.ETMarkets.comReliance Industries Ltd, India's largest company, holds third place in the Nifty 50 index.Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) may tower over India’s corporate landscape with the largest market capitalization on the bourses, but when it comes to the Nifty 50, the benchmark index that mirrors India’s stock market pulse, it plays second, or rather, third fiddle. As of September 30, RIL ranked third in index weight at 8.18%, behind HDFC Bank at 12.87% and ICICI Bank at 8.52%. The reason lies not in its valuation, but in what investors can actually trade.The free-float factorThe Nifty 50 doesn’t assign weight based on total market capitalization. Instead, it uses a free-float market capitalization method, which factors in only the shares available for trading by the public. Promoter holdings, government stakes, and other locked-in shares are excluded.RIL’s promoter group, led by the Ambani family, controls roughly half the company’s shares. That means only the remaining portion, the free float, contributes to its index weight.By contrast, both HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have public shareholding levels above 80%, giving them a far greater representation in the index calculation despite smaller total market caps. In the Nifty’s arithmetic, that translates to more weight, even if the total market value is smaller.This distinction is crucial. As the National Stock Exchange (NSE) explains, the Nifty 50 “is computed using a float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted methodology, wherein the level of the index reflects the float-adjusted market capitalization of all stocks.” The system, adopted in June 2009, ensures that the index reflects the market’s investable portion rather than sheer corporate scale.Why the math favours banksUnder this framework, HDFC Bank’s free-float advantage gives it the heftiest share of the Nifty at 12.87%, followed by ICICI Bank’s 8.52%. Reliance, despite being India’s most valuable company, comes in third at 8.18%.Infosys and Bharti Airtel round out the top five with weights of 4.6% and 4.53%, respectively.Sector-wise, financial services command the largest share of the index at 36.47%, followed by information technology at 9.91% and oil, gas and consumable fuels at 9.79%, the category where Reliance remains the dominant player.This composition means that banking stocks, with their large free floats and high liquidity, exert a stronger influence on the benchmark’s movements than capital-heavy groups with concentrated ownership structures.Also read | 15 stocks to shop for this Diwali; SBI Securities eyes up to 25% upside. Check listWhat it means for investorsFor investors, this weighting system has real implications. A stock’s weight determines how much its price moves sway the Nifty 50. So while Reliance’s size and influence over India Inc. are undeniable, its relatively lower free float keeps its impact on the index below that of HDFC Bank. A 1% swing in HDFC Bank, for instance, nudges the Nifty far more than a similar move in Reliance.In effect, a company with a smaller market cap but a higher free-float ratio can punch above its weight in index terms. The free-float adjustment makes the index more representative of the market’s investable portion and less skewed toward companies with large but tightly held valuations.On Wednesday, October 8, Reliance shares fell 1.3% to Rs 1,367.3, retreating after a 1.6% gain over the previous two sessions. Even so, RIL remains India’s most valuable company, just not the heaviest stock on the Nifty 50.Also read | Tata Steel shares are up 25% in 2025.

    "title": "TCS shares in focus ahead of Q2FY26 results today",
    "content": "Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services company, will be in sharp focus on Thursday, October 9, ahead of the company’s Q2FY26 results announcement later in the day.Brokerages have released a wide range of estimates for the quarter, projecting net profit growth between 3.7% and 9.6% year-on-year (YoY). Profit after tax (PAT) is expected to fall in the range of Rs 12,346 crore to Rs 13,058 crore, while revenue estimates span from Rs 64,200 crore to Rs 65,700 crore, reflecting a YoY increase of 0.7% to 2.2%.The brokerage consensus includes projections from Nomura, Nuvama Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Axis Securities, and HDFC Securities. Among these, Nuvama appears most optimistic, pegging TCS’s PAT at Rs 13,058 crore, up 9.6% YoY and 2.3% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).In contrast, HDFC Securities projects a more conservative PAT of Rs 12,346 crore, reflecting a 3.7% YoY rise but a 3.2% sequential decline. Axis Securities estimates PAT at Rs 12,874 crore, an increase of 7.7% YoY and 0.4% QoQ.Revenue estimates reflect a relatively stable performance, with Nomura expecting Rs 64,259 crore (up 1.4% YoY, 2.7% QoQ), Nuvama at Rs 64,738 crore (up 0.7% YoY, 2.1% QoQ), Motilal Oswal at Rs 65,400 crore (up 1.8% YoY, 3.1% QoQ), Axis Securities at Rs 65,682 crore (up 2.2% YoY, 3.5% QoQ), and HDFC Securities at Rs 65,045 crore (up 1.2% YoY, 2.5% QoQ).Nomura attributes its relatively muted growth projection to a lower BSNL contribution and macroeconomic headwinds, while Axis Securities highlights strength from the BFSI, Hi-Tech, and cross-currency tailwinds.On the EBIT front, estimates again vary, with Nuvama forecasting Rs 15,970 crore (up 3.3% YoY, 2.9% QoQ), Axis Securities estimating Rs 15,928 crore (up 3% YoY, 2.7% QoQ), and HDFC Securities projecting Rs 15,849 crore (up 2.5% YoY, 2.2% QoQ). EBIT margin projections indicate mixed expectations. Nomura anticipates a margin of 24.1% (up 40 bps YoY, flat QoQ), while Nuvama expects a slight improvement to 24.7% (up 60 bps YoY, 20 bps QoQ).Meanwhile, HDFC Securities forecasts a margin of 24.4% (up 30 bps YoY, down 9 bps QoQ), and Motilal Oswal expects a 20 bps QoQ decline, citing wage hikes, talent investments, and lower utilisation as key factors.Brokerages have also outlined key monitorables ahead of the earnings. Nomura will be closely tracking restructuring impacts, client discretionary spending amid U.S. macro volatility, cost takeout initiatives, BFSI vertical growth, and deal wins valued at $7–9 billion excluding mega deals. Nuvama is expected to watch employee restructuring developments.Motilal Oswal has flagged near-term demand, tech budgets, BFSI performance, GenAI transition, pricing trends, and delivery realignments as areas of focus. Axis Securities will be monitoring the H1-B visa impact along with BSNL advance purchase order updates.The broader industry environment has been marked by macroeconomic headwinds and pricing pressure, with clients remaining cautious on large or discretionary tech spending. While analysts expect TCS’s margins to remain stable on a YoY basis, some foresee a sequential decline.Also read: Tata Motors demerger effect: Shares slip 7% in 4 days.

    "title": "TCS to announce Q2 results today: 10 things to track and how to trade",
    "content": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reports its Q2 results today with investors bracing for tepid growth and razor-thin margin movements as the country's largest software exporter navigates headwinds from a planned 12,000-employee separation program, wage revisions, an uncertain US demand and H-1B visa issue.“We expect muted growth from TCS in Q2 as positive momentum in BFSI and tech will be largely offset due to weakness in life science \u0026 healthcare and communications. We are also building in a 10bps of CC (cross currency) headwind on revenues for the quarter,” HSBC’s Yogesh Aggarwal said.While the operating margins are likely to be marginally better sequentially, the positive impact of rupee depreciation is expected to be offset by wage hikes to junior employees. However, the benefit from restructuring may accrue gradually in the coming quarter.Here are 10 crucial factors analysts will scrutinize in TCS Q2 results:1) Impact of layoffsThe spotlight falls squarely on TCS's planned separation of 12,000 employees—roughly 2% of its workforce. Kotak Equities warns that investors will probe the rationale behind this move, its impact on employee morale, and associated costs. While most analysts haven't baked severance charges into their profit estimates, ICICI Securities expects a one-time hit in the September quarter.2) US demand and tariff impactWith President Trump's tariff policies creating uncertainty, the US market outlook becomes critical. Kotak questions \"whether impact on demand resulting from imposition of tariff by the US subsided,\" while HSBC and Nuvama flag US macro concerns as key monitorables. The developed markets have underperformed, raising questions about potential market share losses.Also Read | TCS or Infosys? Which IT company has the highest share of H-1B visa employees3) Revenue growth trajectoryAnalysts estimate flattish quarter-on-quarter constant currency growth. Systematix pegs growth at 1.3%, backed by deal ramp-ups but offset by the BSNL deal wind-down. \"Ramp-downs in a few accounts and weak demand environment will lead to moderate growth,\" Kotak notes.4) Margin performance under pressureEBIT margins face a delicate balancing act. While rupee depreciation provides tailwinds, September 1 wage hikes for junior staff—ranging 4.5-7% for 80% of the workforce—create headwinds. Estimates range from Elara's 20 basis points contraction to Nuvama's 20 bps expansion. ICICI Securities expects margins at 24.6%, up 10 bps, factoring workforce optimization savings.5) Mega deal and TCV pipelineTCS announced a mega deal during the quarter, including the EUR 550 million Tryg contract. Most analysts expect total contract value between $7-10 billion. \"Deal activity continues to remain healthy,\" says Antique Stock Broking, anticipating TCV around $10 billion despite cautious client spending.6) BFSI and key verticals outlookBanking, financial services and insurance remains the crucial vertical to watch. Equirus highlights the need for clarity on \"demand outlook in BFSI, retail, communication, hi-tech and other key segments.\" HSBC expects positive momentum in BFSI and tech, though offset by weakness in life sciences and communications.7) AI threat and pricing pressureThe generative AI transition signals a fundamental realignment in delivery models. Kotak flags concerns about \"pace of GenAI adoption and deflationary impact on spends,\" while Motilal warns that \"pricing pressure, client behavior, and the GenAI transition signal a start of realignment as vendors adapt pricing and delivery models.\"8) International markets performanceGeography mix becomes critical as analysts expect varied performance. Systematix notes that \"in the last quarter, growth was primarily driven by the UK, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe, and MEA markets, with the US and India markets recording muted growth.\" Equirus expects \"growth softness in Int'l markets.\"9) H-1B visa dependencyWork visa risks remain on the radar. Kotak specifically asks about \"H-1B dependence and plans for further derisking,\" while Axis Securities and Equirus list H1B visa impact among key monitorables. The issue gains urgency given the current US administration's immigration stance.10) GCC impact and client decision-makingGlobal capability centers continue disrupting traditional outsourcing. Kotak questions the \"impact of GCC ramp-up on growth of companies and GCC as a growth lever.\" Meanwhile, deal conversion cycles, client decision-making speed and pricing trends in AI-infused deals will signal whether spending patterns are normalizing.How to trade TCS shares amid resultsHistorical patterns suggest potential upside post-earnings, though derivative positioning remains cautious in TCS.\"Over the past decade, TCS has historically delivered an average return of 3.2% in the first week following its Q2 earnings announcement, with this pattern occurring 60% of the time,\" says Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. \"Additionally, 70% of the time, the stock has shown a 7% average return over the subsequent one-month period post-results.\"In the last one month TCS shares have remained flat while they are up 4% in the last one week. \"In 50% of the instances when TCS experienced negative returns in the one month leading up to its Q2 earnings, there was a 60% probability of a 5% average upside in the month following the announcement,\" James notes.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "content": "The Rs 1,377 crore IPO of Rubicon Research will open for subscription on October 9 and will close on October 13. The company, a specialty and generics-focused pharmaceutical manufacturer, is offering shares in the price band of Rs 461–485 per share, valuing it at around Rs 7,990 crore. The issue consists of a fresh issue of Rs 500 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 877 crore.Rubicon Research GMPAccording to market observers, Rubicon Research’s grey market premium (GMP) stood at Rs 90, or around 19% above the upper price band, indicating a firm listing expectation driven by investor interest in the healthcare sector.Brokerage reviewArihant Capital has recommended a \"Subscribe\" rating on the issue, citing strong growth momentum and a diversified product pipeline.\"Rubicon Research is an integrated pharmaceutical product development company with a strong presence in the US generics and specialty markets. Its leadership in the US generics space, combined with expansion into specialty pharmaceuticals through the Validus acquisition, positions it well for long-term growth,\" the brokerage said in its IPO note.The issue is fairly valued at a P/E of around 60 times FY25 earnings, but offers scalability and visibility in global markets.Company overviewRubicon operates across the US, Canada, and India, offering differentiated formulations across generics and specialty drugs. As of June 2025, the company had 72 approved products with the US FDA, 17 awaiting approval, and another 63 in development. It manages three manufacturing facilities in India and two R\u0026D centres — one in India and another in Canada.The company’s acquisition of Validus Pharmaceuticals in the US marks a strategic entry into branded specialty drugs, allowing direct access to prescribers across 44 states.FinancialsFinancially, Rubicon has seen a sharp turnaround. Revenue surged from Rs 4,190 crore in FY23 to Rs 12,962 crore in FY25, while net profit jumped to Rs 1,344 crore from a loss of Rs 169 crore two years earlier. EBITDA margins improved to 21% in FY25, up from 10% in FY23, indicating stronger operational leverage.Analysts believe the IPO could attract both institutional and retail investors looking for exposure to a fast-scaling mid-sized pharma exporter. With improving profitability, global reach, and strategic US expansion, the company appears well placed for long-term value creation.The issue will list on both the NSE and BSE, with Axis Capital as the lead manager and MUFG Intime India as the registrar.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "title": "Canara Robeco AMC IPO opens for subscription; GMP at 13%. Should you apply?",
    "content": "The Rs 1,326 crore IPO of Canara Robeco Asset Management Company will open for subscription on October 9 and will close on October 13. The issue, entirely an offer for sale, is priced between Rs 253 and Rs 266 per share, valuing the fund house at around Rs 5,300 crore.The IPO is one of the first by a public sector-backed mutual fund in recent years and is drawing attention for its growth consistency. The grey market premium (GMP) currently stands at 13%, suggesting moderate listing expectations.Should you subscribe?Analysts are largely optimistic about the long-term prospects, though near-term upside may be limited given sector headwinds.InCred Research, in its pre-IPO note, said the AMC’s retail-focused model and steady AUM expansion make it an attractive play among smaller asset managers.\"At the upper price band of Rs 266, we see higher rerating potential versus other PSU players, given its retail-focused approach,\" the brokerage said.While the IPO is seen as fairly valued, analysts view the offering as a steady, long-term investment rather than a quick listing play.Company overviewCanara Robeco AMC manages an average AUM of Rs 1.03 lakh crore as of FY25, maintaining a stable 1.5% market share. It has focused strongly on active equity schemes, which now form nearly 92% of its total AUM, including 80% in equity and 12% in hybrid funds.About 87% of its assets come from retail and HNI investors, providing a sticky and granular client base. The AMC also leverages Canara Bank’s nationwide branch network and Orix Corporation’s investment expertise, allowing it to balance growth and risk management.FinancialsFinancially, the AMC’s performance has been consistent. Net profit rose from Rs 790 crore in FY23 to Rs 1,907 crore in FY25, while revenue grew from Rs 2,046 crore to Rs 4,037 crore over the same period. Its return on equity (ROE) remains strong at 36.3%, comparable with leading private peers.The company’s equity-heavy portfolio supports higher yield but limits participation in fast-growing passive and ETF categories, analysts noted.Post listing, Canara Bank’s stake in the AMC will fall from 51% to 38%, and the lender will need to trim it further to 30% by FY30 in line with RBI norms.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The QIB category led the issue with 3.42 times, followed by NIIs at 1.98 times and retail investors at 1.10 times.Tata Capital IPO GMPDespite the Tata brand backing, analysts said the grey market premium (GMP) has moderated to around 1%, suggesting limited listing gains. The stock is currently commanding a GMP of Rs 3.5, indicating a potential listing in the range of Rs 330 per share against the issue price of Rs 326.Market experts believe the muted GMP reflects fair valuation rather than lack of investor interest. \"The IPO was priced optimally for long-term investors. Tata Capital’s diversified lending base, prudent risk management, and digital lending push offer steady growth potential,\" analysts said.Tata Capital is the third-largest diversified NBFC in India, offering retail, corporate, and wealth management services.As of June 2025, it operates 1,516 branches across 27 states and union territories, with a growing digital footprint. The company reported a 56% jump in revenue and 10% rise in profit in FY25, with consolidated net profit at Rs 3,655 crore and return on equity (ROE) of 12.6%.Listing outlookWith its clean balance sheet, strong parentage, and broad-based lending model, Tata Capital’s listing is expected to be steady rather than spectacular, mirroring the company’s conservative yet enduring ethos.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

In response, India made plain the deals are price-driven and would continue, although it’s also signalled it wants to buy more US energy amid talks with Washington.Indian refiners are expected to boost oil imports from Russia in the coming months, as trade talks with Washington drag on and discounts widen amid ample supplies.\n\nDiscounts on Urals crude loading in November are $2-to-$2.50 a barrel to Dated Brent, making it attractive, according to people familiar with the developments. That’s cheaper than discounts of about $1 a barrel in July-to-August, when supplies were tight due to Moscow’s prioritising local customers.\n\nFor the current month, ship-tracking data point to an uptick in arrivals. Crude imports from Russia could average about 1.7 million barrels a day in October, according to Kpler Ltd. That would be about 6% higher on-month, but slightly lower than last year’s pace.\nThe US imposed a punitive 50% levy on US imports of Indian goods in August in a bid to pressure New Delhi to curb its appetite for Russian oil, although it’s refrained from similar action against China, another major buyer. In response, India made plain the deals are price-driven and would continue, although it’s also signalled it wants to buy more US energy amid talks with Washington.\n\nStill, at this stage, it remains unclear whether Indian refiners will continue to maximise purchases of discounted Russian crude given the talks with the US, said the people. Last month, officials from New Delhi described meetings as “constructive”, even with Washington’s demand that India stop buying Russian oil.\n\nMeanwhile, India’s state processors have begun talks with national oil companies in the Middle East and Africa for term deals for 2026, the people said. Refiners would be seeking greater volumes from suppliers able to provide flexibility around volumes, such as allowing buyers to resell or optimise cargoes should Russian imports become more viable, they added.\n\nSpokespeople for Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. didn’t reply to an email seeking comments.\n\nRead Also: Garuda Construction and Engineering secures ₹144 crore redevelopment order in Mumbai",

It is also seeking increased funding to support a regular training program for its staff, they said.\n\nThe demand for autonomy underscores the regulator’s assessment that it needs to muscle up and bolster oversight of the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market. Any capacity constraints at the DGCA also risk raising concerns about its ability to ensure safety — a worry amplified after the recent Air India crash that killed all but one passenger and triggered a system-wide audit.\nCurrently, the Indian regulator operates with limited manpower resources and funding that’s a fraction of what its global peers receive.\n\nAs of July, the DGCA had filled only 553 of 1,063 technical posts and employed 4,295 air traffic controllers, the people said. In contrast, the US Federal Aviation Administration has 46,170 employees, including 14,000 controllers and 7,000 safety inspectors.\n\nFor the year ending March 31, the DGCA has been allocated just $38 million, compared to the FAA’s $23.1 billion in fiscal 2024, they added. European Union Aviation Safety Agency, or EASA’s 2024 allocation was eightfold of its Indian counterpart’s while the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority got nearly six times in 2023 of DGCA’s current allocation, the people said.\nThe DGCA and India’s Aviation Ministry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments.\n\nUnlike the DGCA, which operates under India’s Civil Aviation Ministry, the CAA and EASA are independent bodies, the people said. The FAA, under the US Department of Transportation, enjoys relatively limited autonomy, they said.\n\nIndia’s aviation sector has grown consistently over the past decade, with passenger numbers more than doubling to 234 million from 116 million and aircraft fleet size growing over 100% to 841.\n\nRising Workload\n\nIndian carriers have ordered more than 1,300 planes — one of the largest order books from any country — signalling that the regulator’s workload is only going to increase in the coming years.\n\nThe Indian aviation regulator also lacks a formal training module, and funding constraints have hindered efforts to develop specialised programs in collaboration with domestic and international institutions.\n\nThis has led to challenges in deploying qualified inspectors across the country, particularly for certain aircraft types located in regions without trained personnel, the people said.\n\nRead Also: India's apex cotton body says prices at 4-year-low, industry's survival vital to sustain cultivation",

Manufacturers are also required to maintain detailed records of such tests as per Schedule U of the Rules.\n\nDr Raghuvanshi has urged all State and UT Drug Controllers to take immediate measures to ensure compliance, including intensified inspections, monitoring of testing procedures, and sensitising pharmaceutical manufacturers through official circulars. He has also emphasised that companies must have a robust vendor qualification system in place and source raw materials only from reliable, approved vendors.\n\nThe communication reflects heightened regulatory vigilance after multiple incidents of contamination in cough syrups have been linked to adverse health outcomes, both in India and abroad.\n\nThe CDSCO’s latest move seeks to plug systemic gaps in pharmaceutical quality control and ensure public health safety by tightening oversight of testing protocols across the supply chain.\n\nAccording to the communication, state drug authorities have been directed to take strict action and report back on such actions taken in response.(Edited by : Ajay Vaishnav)",

    "content": "Delhi air pollution crisis presents a collection of surprising and alarming facts that highlight its severe impact on the health of residents, the city's infrastructure, and the economy. Here is a list of five facts about Delhi's air quality that may surprise you.As winter arrives in India, generally around the time of the biggest celebration, Diwali, the air in Delhi thickens and turns brown, including visible pollutants. The air quality in the national capital deteriorates annually due to several factors, which include crop stubble burning, vehicular emissions, and industrial smoke.\n\nThe air pollution crisis presents a collection of surprising and alarming facts that highlight its severe impact on the health of residents, the city's infrastructure, and the economy. Here is a list of five facts about Delhi's air quality that may surprise you.\n\n1. The Red Fort is losing its red colour and turning black: The iconic 17th-century Red Fort's signature red sandstone is gradually turning black, and the culprit is the city’s worsening air pollution. According to a joint study by Indian and Italian researchers published in the Heritage journal, researchers found black crusts of pollutants building up on the monument's walls.\n\n2. Two lakh residents reported air pollution hospitalisations between 2022-24: Over 2 lakh Delhi residents were hospitalised for respiratory issues linked to air pollution between 2022 and 2024, according to a report citing data from six central hospitals. In 2024 alone, over 68,000 cases of Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) were reported in Delhi.\n\n3. Air pollution has resulted in lung damage for millions of children: The poor air quality in the city has caused irreversible lung damage to about 2.2 million children. This prolonged exposure can also lead to chronic respiratory conditions like asthma and increase the risk of heart and neurological diseases later in life.\n\n4. It is ageing residents faster: The Delhi pollution is accelerating the physical ageing process. The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that chokes residents' lungs also penetrates deep into the skin layers, resulting in inflammation, oxidative stress and the breakdown of collagen.\n\n“Air pollution carries tiny particles called particulate matter (PM). This would penetrate deep skin layers and cause inflammation, giving dark spots and a dull look. Exposure over time to air pollution is likely to compromise the natural barrier that the skin possesses, thereby becoming dehydrated and irritated and, thus, making visible signs of ageing,” Dr Ruben Bhasin Passi, Consultant - Dermatology, CK Birla Hospital Gurugram, said, according to a 2024 report in Times Now.\n\n5. Microplastics in the air: A recent report revealed that microplastics—tiny plastic particles invisible to the naked eye—are present in Delhi's air year-round. It found that Delhi adults inhale nearly twice as many microplastic particles in summer (21.1 daily) as in winter (10.7 daily), highlighting a 97% jump. Adults in Delhi may inhale between 1,935 and 5,621 microplastic particles annually.\n\nAlso Read: Delhi to move Supreme Court to allow certified green firecrackers on Diwali(Edited by : Priyanka Deshpande)",

These guidelines, however, do not take into account an irreparable mental trauma, agony, upheaval and derangement of the victims and their family members, the collective conscience of the nation and the deterrent effect which the capital punishment intends to make.\"",

That's Nandan Nilekani's vision for a 'finternet'—a tokenized, AI-driven world where assets like gold and real estate become more easily transactable.The man who built Aadhaar now wants to build an internet for finance (finternet) that makes trading traditionally illiquid assets far easier than it is today.\n\"We'll be live in 2026,\" Nilekani announced at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai. The goal, he said, is to unlock the \"trillions of dollars\" Indians have parked in gold and real estate and put that wealth to work.\nNilekani aims to take his next big project beyond India to Singapore, New York, San Francisco, and Switzerland.\n\"We think tokenisation and AI will catalyse that change,\" he said. \nWhat is tokenisation?\nWhen an asset is tokenised, each token then represents a piece or the whole of that asset which can then be bought, sold, or traded digitally. For instance, a building worth ₹10 crore can be tokenised into 1,000 tokens.\nA person can buy fractions of that property, say two tokens of it worth  ₹1 lakh each which makes transferring ownership easy. The same logic applies for gold or any other asset class.\n\"Tokenisation is nothing but allowing an asset to travel with all its attributes,\" Nilekani explained.\n\"What we're suggesting is using tokenisation inside a regulatory framework, embedded compliance, but unlocking the potential of tokenised assets,\" he added.\nHow does the 'finternet' work\nDemonstrations at the annual fest show that the finternet features an AI chatbot that helps the user navigate investments and trade assets to gain ownership of real estate properties.\nThe user should first sign up and get a \"finternet address\" to store identities, credentials, or any type of asset. Those who already have their identity documents on DigiLocker can import them directly, build an online profile, and link it to their bank, investment, and tax accounts.\n\"Real estate builders will tokenise the product that they are building. Once done, they can request third-party auditors, testers to verify all the provenance behind that and submit proofs,\" a team member of finternet presented.\nThe platform's Approved Project Financing (APF) does due diligence for both the real estate builder or property owner as well as for the borrower or buyer.\n'Financial inclusion to ignition'\nBesides finternet, Nandan Nilekani highlighted more areas of growth despite India succeeding at digital identities, payments, and e-signing which he said was another \"silent success\".\n\"Go beyond inclusion to allow people to meet their aspirations and empower them even further. There are many things to it. While we have done a great job on ID in individuals, we have to do better on ID for businesses,\" he said.\n\"We need a single business ID around which we can do things,\" he added.\nNilekani also highlighted the need to make cross-border financial services better, especially as India is the largest receiver of inward remittances in the world.",

In 2020, residents of a village witnessed a stunning view of Mount Everest from their house.\n\nMeteorologists attribute the rare visibility to a haze-free atmosphere, which is often a result of heavy rainfall clearing particulate matter and dust from the air. This allows for unobstructed views of distant peaks, even those hundreds of kilometres away. The clear skies and reduced pollution levels created perfect conditions for the Himalayan range to be seen in all its glory.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)First Published: Oct 8, 2025 7:03 PM IST",

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) approved the withdrawal and accepted the consent terms on Wednesday, as reported by Live Law.\n\nThe issue focuses on a trade-licence agreement that Jerai Fitness signed in October 2018 that granted them the authority to produce and sell workout equipment using Salman Khan's trademark, ‘BEING STRONG.’\n\nAccording to the actor, Jerai failed to pay royalties, although the new conditions were agreed upon because of the COVID-19 pandemic's disruptions. Salman's legal team submitted a demand notice in September 2024, requesting ₹7.24 crore plus interest at a rate of 24% annually.\n\nSalman previously filed a default claim with the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) Mumbai bench. The NCLT, however, rejected his appeal in May 2025, noting that only ₹1.63 crore was uncontested and that the remaining amount contained significant pre-existing contractual disputes over product lines, rights, and authorisations.\n\nUnresolved issues included marketing, distribution, and prior approvals, as well as Jerai's investment in new product lines (like the ‘X-tend’ and ‘Proton’ series), according to Livemint.\n\nAccording to NCLT, Jerai Fitness was not allowed to distribute any goods using the name that were not expressly pre-approved. The tribunal went on to state that the claim was “in the domain of recovery proceedings” rather than resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).\n\nDissatisfied with the NCLT's decision, Salman filed an appeal with NCLAT, and the matter was heard on October 6, which was later postponed. NCLAT has disposed of the appeal, and the settlement is now recorded, thus ending the two parties' insolvency litigation.\n\nChairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan and Technical Member Arun Baroka made up the bench that took the consent.\n\nSalman Khan was represented by attorneys Parag Khandhar, Varun Kalra, Tapan Radkar, and Shaham Ulla on the legal teams under the direction of DSK Legal.

(PTI Photo))A BJP leader from Tamil Nadu has moved the Supreme Court, seeking a CBI probe into the September 27 stampede at Karur during a political rally of actor and TVK founder Vijay that killed 41 people and injured more than 60.\n\nThe plea, filed by GS Mani, an apex court lawyer and the vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) state legal cell, has also sought a stay on the Tamil Nadu Police's probe into the Karur incident.\n\nThe top court has already listed other related pleas for a hearing on October 10.\n\nIn his plea filed through Advocate-on-Record R Sathish, Mani has urged the court to transfer the probe from the Tamil Nadu Police to either the CBI or an independent Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by a current or former Supreme Court judge.\n\n\"The petitioner who is a public-spirited citizen and also a regular practising advocate of this court... has filed this SLP against the impugned common final judgment... dated October 3... in a batch of writ petitions including... filed by him, seeking transfer of investigation from the respondent state's local police to the CBI and payment of adequate compensation in relation to a stampede incident at a political meeting in Karur District, Tamil Nadu,\" the plea says.\n\nRead more: CJI Gavai attack: Supreme Court lawyer seeks contempt proceedings against Rakesh Kishore\n\nIt says the high court had held that sweeping allegations, without tangible material, cannot justify transferring the investigation to a central agency.\n\n\"The (high) court also declined to direct enhanced compensation, noting that the state government had announced compensation of ₹10 lakh to each victim's family, while the political party had announced ₹20 lakh. The incident is not only a case of criminal negligence but also a gross violation of Article 21 of the Constitution,\" the plea says.\n\nA free, fair and impartial investigation is part of the fundamental right to life and liberty not only of the victims but also of every citizen, it says.\n\n\"Where the state machinery itself is under suspicion, investigation must be entrusted to an independent agency like the CBI, or a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by a retired/sitting judge of the Supreme Court,\" the plea says.\n\nThe petitioner has also sought enhanced compensation for the victims, urging the court to direct the state government and TVK to pay higher ex-gratia amounts.\n\nThe plea has demanded a compensation of ₹50 lakh per deceased from the state government and ₹1 crore each from the actor and his political party.\n\nSo far, the Tamil Nadu government has provided a compensation of ₹10 lakh per deceased, while Vijay has contributed ₹20 lakh each from his personal funds.\n\nOn October 3, the high court formed an SIT to probe the stampede.\n\nRead more: Here are all the states that have banned cough syrups for children below 2 years\n\nThe principal bench of the high court also dismissed a BJP leader's plea seeking a CBI probe into the incident and directed her to approach the Madurai bench.\n\nThe high court formed the SIT under senior IPS officer and Inspector General, North Zone, Asra Garg. It also criticised the organisers of the event, the TVK leadership and police over the stampede, which killed multiple women and children, among others.\n\nA total of 41 people died in the stampede, with police noting that the rally saw a turnout of 27,000, nearly three times the expected figure of 10,000.\n\nPolice also blamed a seven-hour delay on Vijay's part in reaching the venue for the tragedy.",

    "content": "HomeTravel NewsRelief for train travellers: You will soon be able to reschedule tickets without any extra chargeIn case passengers plan to reschedule tickets, getting confirmed tickets for another date will depend on seat availability. \"There’s no guarantee of getting a confirmed ticket for the new date,\" said Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.Train travel can at times become a burden rather than a boon, especially when you need to reschedule your travel date. For instance, if you plan to travel on October 15 and for some unavoidable reason, you need to postpone your journey to another date, the procedure at present requires the traveller to cancel the existing ticket an rebook for another date, depending on how close to the travel time you cancel the ticket.\n\nSo, in the current cancellation framework, passengers who cancel their confirmed tickets between 48 and 12 hours prior to departure lose 25% of the fare. This percentage increases further for cancellations made closer to departure, and once the reservation chart is prepared, refunds are not permitted, thus the traveller losing a significant amount.\n\nCome January, passengers will be allowed to reschedule confirmed railway tickets without paying any extra cost. Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently said that a new provision will be introduced in January 2026 that seeks to alleviate the stress and financial loss associated with last-minute travel plan changes. Rather than cancelling tickets, passengers will have the option to change their travel date online, without facing penalties.\n\nAlso read | Vande Bharat sleeper trains to launch once second rake arrives post October 15: Railway minister\n\nHowever, Vaishnaw clarified that rescheduling tickets and getting confirmed tickets for another date will depend on seat availability. \"There’s no guarantee of getting a confirmed ticket for the new date,\" he said, according to reports. If the new ticket is priced higher than the original, the passenger will be required to pay the difference in fare.\n\nThe move is expected to benefit millions of passengers across the country who currently face limited flexibility and financial loss when they need to unexpectedly alter travel dates.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved four major multi-tracking railway projects across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Chhattisgarh. The projects, with an estimated investment of ₹24,634 crore, aim to boost capacity and improve connectivity across 18 districts.\n\nA Railway official was quoted as saying by PTI that the projects will expand Indian Railways' existing network by approximately 894 km, enabling smoother movement of people, goods, and services. The approved works includes the laying of a third and fourth line between Wardha and Bhusawal, spanning 314 km in Maharashtra, an 84 km fourth line between Gondia and Dongargarh, covering Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and a 259 km third and fourth line between Vadodara and Ratlam in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAlso read | Vande Bharat trains will not run on this route, confirms Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw\n\n\"The approved multi-tracking project will enhance connectivity to approximately 3,633 villages, which have a population of about 85.84 lakh and two Aspirational Districts (Vidisha and Rajnandgaon),” a statement from the Railways Ministry said.\n\nVaishnaw, added that the expansion of line capacity would boost mobility and improve the operational efficiency and reliability of railway services. \"The projects are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji’s vision of a New India which will make the people of the region 'Aatmanirbhar' by way of comprehensive development in the area that will enhance their employment/self-employment opportunities,\" PTI quoted him as saying.(Edited by : Jerome Anthony)First Published: Oct 8, 2025 2:44 PM IST",

The controversy erupted following the discovery of significant discrepancies in the weight of gold-plated copper panels that were sent for repairs. The developments in the matter include a judicial probe, the suspension of a temple official, and ongoing political protests.\n\nUproar in Kerala assembly for third day\n\nOn Wednesday, the Kerala Legislative Assembly was rocked by opposition parties protesting the Sabarimala gold plating controversy for the third day in a row. Shortly after the day's proceedings began, opposition MLAs stormed the assembly well, chanting slogans and brandishing placards demanding the resignation of Devaswom Minister V N Vasavan and the dissolution of the Travancore Devaswom Boards (TDB).\n\nDemanding the resignation of Kerala Devaswom minister, Leader of the Opposition VD Satheeshan said, “For the past two days, the opposition has not cooperated with the Assembly proceedings. We will continue to withhold cooperation in legislative proceedings until the Devaswom Minister resigns.”\n\nNo offender will be allowed to escape..., says Kerala CM\n\nChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared on Wednesday that the Kerala government would not spare any wrongdoers, take action without favour, or let anyone involved in the Sabarimala gold plating incident get away with it.\n\n“In the Sabarimala gold plating controversy, the government announced an investigation right from the beginning. We will never protect any wrongdoers. The government's stance is to take action without favour, regardless of who is at fault. A special investigation team was appointed in this matter,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.\nThe Chief Minister added that the government has been investigating the matter since the beginning, and that following the High Court ruling, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been constituted for the case, overseen by the Additional Director General of Police (ADGP).\n\nSabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajam calls for CBI probe\n\nThe Sabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajam (SASS) has asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the alleged gold theft.\n\nSASS National Chairman SJR Kumar stated in a letter to the Kerala Additional Chief Secretary (Home) that an investigation conducted by the Devaswom Vigilance or the Kerala State Police cannot be expected to reveal the full truth because there is a serious possibility of interference or manipulation by the parties involved.\n\n“Only a neutral and central agency like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) can ensure a fair, transparent, and credible inquiry. I, National Chairman of Sabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajam and a devotee of Lord Ayyappa, wish to bring to your urgent attention serious revelations regarding the theft and substitution of gold claddings from the Sabarimala Temple, carried out under the guise of gold plating and repair,” Kumar said.\n\nTravancore Devaswom Board suspends officer over 'false' report\n\nThe Travancore Devaswom Board on Tuesday suspended B Murari Babu, Deputy Devaswom Commissioner for Haripad, in connection with the alleged irregularities. The senior official was suspended for allegedly submitting a misleading report about the Sabarimala gold plating of the temple's 'Dwarapalaka' idols.\n\nAs per the board, the incident occurred on June 17, 2019, while Murari Babu was the administrative officer at the temple.\n\nHe apparently submitted a report to the Sabarimala Executive Officer that falsely represented the gold-plated Dwarapalaka idols on either side of the sanctum sanctorum (Sreekovil) as copper sheets. Terming it a serious administrative lapse, the board has placed Murari Babu under suspension pending a detailed inquiry.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "HomeTechnology NewsTinder in India now checks video selfies to block fake profilesTinder has rolled out Face Check in India, a new feature that uses video selfies to verify users, reduce fake profiles to enhance safety for those seeking connections on the app.Online dating app Tinder, on Wednesday, introduced a new feature in India called Face Check to help users avoid fake profiles and make the app safer. The tool requires new users to record a short video selfie. This selfie is then compared to the photos they have on their profile.\n\nIf the pictures match, the user receives a Photo Verified badge, which signals to others that the person is real and not a bot or someone using fake photos.\n\nTinder says Face Check is part of its ongoing efforts to limit scams, bots, and impersonation on the platform. The company has previously introduced several safety tools for Indian users, such as:\n \tID Verification – Users can verify their identity by submitting official identification documents.\n \tWarnings – Alerts that notify users if someone is sending suspicious or harmful messages.\n \tAre You Sure – A feature that asks users to reconsider before sending messages that might be offensive.\n \tDoes This Bother You – Allows users to report behaviour they find uncomfortable or inappropriate.\n \tReporting enhancements – Improvements to how users can report suspicious or unsafe accounts.\n\nAccording to Tinder’s Modern Dating Report, many young Indian users value authenticity and safety. More than one in three consider profile verification an important factor when choosing potential matches.\n\nUsers also take other precautions, such as meeting in public places (50%), sharing plans with friends or family (42%), avoiding sharing personal information (40%), and video calling before meeting someone in person (37%).",

While spending on vegetables, fruits, and processed foods has gone up, which the new inflation basket will reflect.India’s upcoming base year revisions for GDP, CPI and IIP will significantly expand the base and coverage of sectors, particularly if the government gets access to more granular data, MoSPI Secretary Saurabh Garg said in an interaction with CNBC-TV18.\n\nGarg said the national accounts and GDP series will draw from new and alternate data sources, including GST data, digital platforms such as e-VAHAN, and payments data.\n\n“The new series will capture a much larger part of the digital economy. GDP coverage will increase as we incorporate more real-time and electronic data,” he explained.\n\nGarg added that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will also see a substantial overhaul. The CPI basket size will rise from 299 to over 350 items, “at least”, with e-commerce to be included for the first time.\n\n“A lot of digital products will move into the CPI basket, capturing products and sources of data, like where the households are purchasing - the revision will increase the number of markets, products and types of markets from where you are getting the data,\" Garg said.\n\nWith the proportion of food items in the CPI having come down as per the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey, the weightage of food, particularly cereals, in the new CPI is also expected to decline. While spending on vegetables, fruits, and processed foods has gone up, which the new inflation basket will reflect.\n\nThe Index of Industrial Production (IIP) will similarly undergo expansion, with more sectors being added to better capture industrial activity.\n“In all three revisions — national accounts, CPI, and IIP — the coverage will deepen and granularity will increase, as more data sources are brought in. This will help us build a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the economy,” the MoSPI Secretary said.\n\nAccording to Garg, the new data series will roll out in early 2026.\n\n• The new CPI series with 2024 as the base year for January will be released on February 12, 2026.\n\n• The revised GDP series with 2022–23 as the base year will be released by the end of February 2026, meaning the Second Advance Estimates of FY26 GDP will be on the new base year.\n\n• The new IIP series, based on April 2026 data, will be released in May 2026.\n\nFor CPI and IIP, the government is not considering any changes to the release timelines.\n\n“All the base year revisions are on track. By early 2026, the economy’s key indicators—GDP, CPI, and IIP—will all reflect these changes,” Garg affirmed.\n\nThe MoSPI (Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation) will start stakeholder consultations on the new methodologies for each of the data sets by the end of this month or early November, initially in Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nRead Also: Ixigo-parent shares in focus after unnamed investor intends to buy up to 16% stakeFirst Published: Oct 8, 2025 8:31 AM IST",

    "content": "Five smart gadgets that will help you breathe cleaner air at homeFrom air purifiers to smart sensors, these five gadgets will help you create a cleaner, healthier indoor environment for your home. Read on:1 / 7With rising levels of indoor and outdoor pollution, ensuring clean air inside homes has become increasingly important. From dust and allergens to mould spores and harmful gases, indoor air can often contain hidden pollutants that affect health and comfort. A range of innovative devices now make it easier to monitor and improve indoor air quality. Take a look at five smart gadgets that can help you breathe easier at home. (PTI Photo)2 / 71. Air Purifiers are widely recognised as one of the most effective tools for improving indoor air quality. Equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, they trap airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns, including pollen, pet dander, dust, and some bacteria. These devices are especially beneficial for households with pets or people suffering from allergies. Some advanced models also combine HEPA filtration with UV-C light technology, providing an additional layer of protection by neutralising microorganisms. (Photo: Shutterstock)3 / 72. Smart Air Quality Monitors help in understanding what all substances are there in the air. They track levels of pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PM 2.5 particles, and humidity. These compact sensors display real-time data on mobile apps, enabling homeowners to adjust ventilation or activate purifiers as needed. (Image: Rob Schultz_IDG)4 / 73. Humidifiers: Dry indoor air can lead to respiratory discomfort and skin irritation, especially in colder months. Smart humidifiers maintain optimal moisture levels between 40% and 60%, helping prevent dryness while supporting better respiratory health. Some models also clean water before releasing mist and allow the addition of essential oils for a fresher environment. (Image: Wikipedia)5 / 74. UV Air Treatment Systems, often integrated into HVAC units, these gadgets use ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, viruses, and mould spores as air circulates. This creates an additional barrier against airborne pathogens, reducing the spread of illnesses. Such systems are particularly useful during flu season or in homes with vulnerable individuals. (Representative Image from Wikipedia)6 / 75. Smart Thermostats: Modern smart thermostats offer air quality monitoring features in addition to temperature control. They can detect when indoor air becomes polluted and automatically trigger ventilation systems to refresh the air. Real-time data is accessible via mobile apps, enabling users to maintain healthy indoor conditions with minimal effort. (Image: Wikipedia)7 / 7Investing in a combination of these devices can significantly enhance indoor air quality. Whether through filtration, monitoring, humidity control, or germicidal technology, these smart gadgets are making homes healthier and more comfortable because breathing clean air keeps you healthy.

    "content": "HomeIndia NewsHealthcare NewsDrug Controller recommends Sresan Pharma's licence cancellation after high DEG levels found in cough syrupsThe deaths of children due to consumption of these contaminated cough syrups have reignited concerns about quality control lapses in India’s pharmaceutical supply chain. Read on:In the wake of the tragic deaths of several children suspected to be linked to the consumption of contaminated cough syrup, the central and state drug regulators have swung into action.\n\nSources told CNBC-TV18 that a series of tests conducted over the past few days have confirmed the presence of diethylene glycol (DEG)—a toxic industrial solvent—in certain cough syrup samples, leading the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to recommend the cancellation of Sresan Pharma’s manufacturing licence.\n\nAccording to sources, 19 samples have been tested so far by the CDSCO, Madhya Pradesh Food and Drugs Administration (MP FDA), and Tamil Nadu Food and Drugs Administration (TN FDA), as authorities attempt to trace the source of the contamination that has raised nationwide alarm.\n\nThe first set of test results, sources said, came on October 3, when six samples tested by CDSCO and three by MP FDA were found to be free of DEG and ethylene glycol (EG). However, the situation changed dramatically later that night when the TN FDA submitted test results of Coldrif syrup, manufactured by Sresan Pharma, which revealed 48% DEG—a level hundreds of times above the permissible limit of 0.1%.\n\nThe following day, on October 4, more samples of Coldrif collected from retail outlets and pharmacies in Madhya Pradesh were tested, again confirming the presence of 46% DEG, sources said. By the end of the day, 10 samples had been tested, several of which confirmed the same pattern of contamination in syrups produced by Sresan Pharma.\n\nRead more: Cough syrup linked deaths: PIL seeks Supreme Court intervention as toll rises, MP bans 2 more drugs\n\nSources further said that on October 5 and 6, additional test reports from the MP FDA revealed that two other products—Refile Syrup and Respifresh TR Syrup—also contained DEG, though at relatively lower levels. Refile Syrup showed 0.616% DEG and Respifresh TR Syrup showed 1.342% DEG, but these were still above the permissible limit.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, sources told CNBC-TV18 that the DCGI has written to the Tamil Nadu FDA, urging immediate cancellation of Sresan Pharma’s licence. Officials have also been asked to step up vigilance and conduct a wider probe to identify other manufacturers possibly flouting drug safety norms.\n\nThe deaths have reignited concerns about quality control lapses in India’s pharmaceutical supply chain, especially after previous global incidents involving DEG contamination in cough syrups exported from India. Regulatory authorities are now under growing pressure to ensure strict enforcement of manufacturing standards and prevent further tragedies.\n\nFurther action from both central and state agencies is awaited as investigations continue into how the contamination occurred and whether lapses in testing or oversight contributed to the crisis.\n\nRead more: Explained: What is DEG, the industrial toxin being linked to child deaths from cough syrup in MP and Rajasthan",

    "content": "HomeBusiness NewsAviation NewsHow to reach Navi Mumbai International Airport: Routes, travel time \u0026 connectivity explainedNavi Mumbai International Airport is set to begin operations by mid-December. Here’s a guide on routes, travel times, and connectivity from key city locations ahead of its launch.\n\nThe Navi Mumbai International Airport will be inaugurated on October 8, with commercial operations expected to start by mid-December 2025. Before flights begin, the terminal approach area must be completed, followed by security clearance checks by the CISF—a process that will take roughly 45 days. The Airports Authority of India will then give its final approval.\n\nInitially, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) will operate flights from 8 AM to 8 PM, meaning only daytime operations will begin. Since international flights typically operate at night, these will be introduced later. \nThe first flights will be operated by Air India, IndiGo, and Akasa Air, while international airlines will be added in a subsequent phase once night operations are cleared.\n\nThe airport will start with one runway and one terminal, handling 10–12 air traffic movements per hour and up to 20 million passengers annually. The second terminal is expected to be ready by 2029, adding capacity for 30 million passengers, with a total of four terminals planned to handle 90–100 million passengers yearly.How to Reach Navi Mumbai International Airport\n \tFrom South Mumbai: Freeway → Atal Setu → Ulwe-Belapur Road (~60+ minutes)\n \tFrom Powai: Eastern Express Highway → Vashi Bridge → Thane-Belapur Road → Belapur-Ulwe Road (~60+ minutes)\n \tFrom Thane: Eastern Express Highway → Mumbra-Airoli Road → Thane-Belapur Road → Belapur-Ulwe Road (~70 minutes)\n \tFrom Goregaon: Western Express Highway → Sea Link → Worli → Freeway → Atal Setu → Ulwe-Belapur Road (~90+ minutes)\n \tFrom Mira Road: Ghodbunder Road → Thane-Belapur Road → Belapur-Ulwe Road (~2+ hours; early start recommended)\n\nInside the Airport\n\nNavi Mumbai Airport will have four entry gates, 66 check-in counters, and 22 self-baggage drop counters. After security, passengers enter a spacious shopping and dining zone with 112 retail and F\u0026B outlets, ranging from athleisure and luxury brands to confectionery and cosmetics. Around 45–50 stores will open initially.\n\nAlso Read: PM Modi to visit Maharashtra on October 8-9 to inaugurate major projects | Full schedule here\n\n\n\nBoarding facilities include 29 aerobridge gates and 10 bus gates. The airport aims to become an international hub, enabling direct connections from India to major global cities, reducing dependence on Middle Eastern transit hubs. It is designed for seamless transfers between domestic and international flights without re-clearing customs and immigration. However, realising this hub model will require policy support from the government.(Edited by : Sheersh Kapoor)",

His journey began on October 7, 2001, when he took the oath as the Chief Minister of Gujarat.\n\nExpressing gratitude to the people of India in a series of posts on X, he vowed to work with renewed determination to fulfil the vision of a 'Viksit Bharat'.\n\nOn X, PM Modi said that it has always been his endeavour to enhance people's lives and contribute to the country's progress.\n\n“On this day in 2001, I took the oath as Gujarat’s Chief Minister for the first time. Thanks to the continuous blessings of my fellow Indians, I am entering my 25th year of serving as the head of a Government. My gratitude to the people of India. Through all these years, it has been my constant endeavour to improve the lives of our people and contribute to the progress of this great nation that has nurtured us all,” he wrote.\nOn this day in 2001, I took oath as Gujarat’s Chief Minister for the first time.

First, you will always work for the poor and second, you will never take a bribe,” he added.\n\nHe further mentioned in his post that these 25 years of service had been ‘filled with many experiences’, during which India made ‘remarkable strides’.\nTalking about his tenure as Gujarat CM, he noted that through collective effort, Gujarat became a “powerhouse of good governance”.\n\nOnce drought-prone, the state became a top performer in agriculture, Modi said. “The culture of trading expanded into robust industrial and manufacturing capacities. Regular curfews became a thing of the past. Social and physical infrastructure received a boost. It was very satisfying to be able to work with the people to achieve these outcomes,” he added.\n\nReflecting on national leadership, Modi also looked back on his nomination as the BJP's prime ministerial candidate in 2013, a time when he noted the country was facing a “crisis of trust and governance”.\n\n“The then UPA Government was synonymous with the worst form of corruption, cronyism and policy paralysis. India was seen as a weak link in the global order. But, the wisdom of the people of India gave our alliance a thumping majority and also ensured that our party got an absolute majority, a first after three long decades,” Modi mentioned in his post.\n\nOver the past 11 years, Modi said that India has seen many transformations, empowering citizens, including women, youth, and farmers. “Over the last 11 years, we, The People of India, have worked together and achieved many transformations. Our path-breaking efforts have empowered people from all across India, especially our Nari Shakti, Yuva Shakti and hardworking Annadatas,” Modi said.\n\nHe stated that more than 25 crore people have been lifted out of poverty and that India is now seen as a “bright spot among major global economies”.\n\n“Our farmers are innovating and ensuring that our nation is self-reliant. We have undertaken extensive reforms, and the popular sentiment is to make India Aatmanirbhar across all sectors, reflecting in the clarion call of ‘Garv Se Kaho, Yeh Swadeshi Hai’,” he said.\n\nModi concluded his post by reaffirming his commitment to the people of India and vowing to \"work even harder in the times to come to realise our collective dream of a Viksit Bharat.\"\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is currently the second-longest-serving PM of the country. He recently completed 4,078 consecutive days in office, surpassing former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s uninterrupted tenure of 4,077 days.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

Several parts of the state witnessed heavy rains and floods recently, causing widespread damage.\n\nIt is estimated that crops on over 65-68 lakh hectares were destroyed in the floods. Crops such as cotton, soybean, oranges, pomegranate, maize, bajra, pulses, and onion have been hit the hardest.\n\nAs many as 29 out of 36 districts and 253 (out of 358) talukas suffered due to the heavy rains, the chief minister said.\n\nThe ₹31,000 crore flood relief package will include everything from crop damage compensation to restoring eroded farms,  ex-gratia payments to victims, medical bills, compensation for house damage, etc.\n\nOut of this ₹31,000 crore package, ₹17,675 crore will be provided as crop compensation, ₹30,000 per damaged well, and ₹10,000 per hectare support for the upcoming Rabi season will be provided to farmers.\n\nAs to the loss of livestock, farmers will receive ₹32,000 per animal, he said. While sowing had taken place over a total of 1.43 lakh hectares at the start of the monsoon, crops over 68 lakh hectares of land were damaged, Fadnavis said, adding that as much as 60,000 hectares of farmland were damaged due to the top layer of soil getting washed away.\n\nAlso, 45 lakh farmers who have crop insurance will get ₹17,000 per hectare in insurance money, he said.\n\nThe Opposition had also urged the state to declare a \"wet drought\". Incessant rains in September in various parts of the state, including the capital Mumbai and its metropolitan region, threw life out of gear. Hundreds of people had to be shifted to safety due to flooding, which also damaged crops on a large scale.\n\nA \"wet drought\" is a meteorological phenomenon wherein an area receives abundant rainfall, but the availability of water remains low, causing agricultural loss.First Published: Oct 7, 2025 4:05 PM IST",

The capacity expansion is expected to handle additional freight traffic of about 78 million tonnes per annum.\n\nThe projects will contribute to environmental goals by reducing logistics costs, cutting oil imports by about 28 crore litres, and lowering carbon emissions by around 139 crore kilograms—equivalent to planting six crore trees.",

Some of it is portfolio-driven, but a lot of it also has to do with GST 2.0 for autos,” Nalinikanth said. “We’re quite optimistic about a strong festive season.”\n\nThe company has passed on the full benefit of GST changes to customers, helping to offset price sensitivity amid global raw material volatility.\n\n“Our intent when the government announced the policy was to ensure its benefits reached customers directly, and we did that,” he said. “If the macro environment changes, we’ll reassess, but for now, we’re happy to keep our products attractive.”\n\nMahindra is also preparing to strengthen its presence in the electric vehicle (EV) segment, with a new model set to debut in November. The company believes the segment has firmly entered the mainstream, with Vahan registrations surpassing 14,000 in September—the highest ever for EVs.\n“EVs are clearly a focus area for us. The industry will ultimately move in that direction,” Nalinikanth noted. “With our new launch, we’ll further strengthen that momentum.”\n\nThe company is observing changing buyer behaviour, with customers opting for higher variants or moving directly from hatchbacks to SUVs. “Entry-level SUVs have become more accessible, and we’re seeing many customers trading up within our own SUV lineup,” he added.\n\nWhile Mahindra continues to explore alternative powertrains, compressed natural gas (CNG) is not an immediate priority.\n\n“Right now, CNG doesn’t fully align with our ‘power on tap’ philosophy. But as technology evolves, we’ll keep evaluating it,” he said.\n\nFestive Outlook Strong\n\nWith Navratri driving robust footfall and Diwali approaching, Mahindra expects momentum to continue.\n\n“Footfalls and inquiries have been strong, and we expect them to convert into bookings and retail sales as the season progresses,” Nalinikanth said.\n\nMahindra enters the festive quarter with strong tailwinds—GST-driven affordability, surging SUV demand, and the promise of an EV-powered expansion.(Edited by : Vivek Dubey)",

    "content": "As Karwa Chauth 2025 approaches, women across India prepare to observe a day-long fast for the well-being and longevity of their husbands. To help you stay energised, hydrated, and healthy throughout the day, here are some essential fasting tips to follow.1 / 71. Begin the Day with a Nutritious Sargi | The pre-dawn meal, or Sargi, is crucial for sustaining energy. Include complex carbohydrates like oats or whole-wheat parathas, proteins such as paneer or eggs, and hydrating fruits like watermelon or papaya. Nutritionists recommend avoiding sugary foods early in the morning, as they can cause fatigue later in the day. (Image: Canva)2 / 72. Stay Hydrated Before Sunrise | Hydration is key to avoiding weakness during the fast. Drink plenty of water, coconut water, or lemon-infused water before the fasting period begins. According to health experts, consuming fluids helps maintain electrolyte balance throughout the day. (Image: Canva)3 / 73. Avoid Caffeine and Fried Foods | While it may be tempting to have tea or coffee before the fast, caffeine can lead to dehydration. Instead, opt for herbal tea or milk. Similarly, fried or oily foods can cause acidity, making fasting more difficult. (Image: Canva)4 / 74. Stay Indoors and Avoid Physical Exertion | Since Karwa Chauth involves a full-day fast without food or water, try to rest as much as possible. Avoid strenuous activities or exposure to the sun, as it can lead to exhaustion and dehydration. (Image: Canva)5 / 75. Keep Your Mind Engaged | Distraction helps time pass more easily. Read, watch light shows, or engage in relaxing activities like mehndi application. Staying positive and calm helps maintain mental energy during the long fast. (Image: Canva)6 / 76. Break the Fast Gently | When the moon rises, avoid breaking the fast with heavy or fried foods. Start with water and a few dates to stabilise blood sugar levels, followed by a light meal including soup, rice, and vegetables. (Image: Shutterstock)7 / 77. Focus on Post-Fast Recovery | After a day of fasting, your body needs nourishment. Ensure your dinner includes balanced portions of proteins, carbs, and fibre. Experts suggest sipping warm water or herbal tea to aid digestion before sleeping. (Image: Canva)",

It's used in brake fluids, paints, and lubricants, and is safe only in controlled industrial use. But if it contaminates other consumables, for example — pharmaceutical-grade ingredients, even in trace amounts, it becomes lethal — damaging the kidneys, liver, and nervous system.The recent deaths of more than a dozen children in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, reportedly linked to cough syrups contaminated with Diethylene Glycol, or DEG, have once again brought this industrial toxin under intense scrutiny — exposing deep cracks in India's pharmaceutical quality control.\n\nWhat is DEG?\n\nIt's an industrial solvent — colourless, odourless, and deceptively sweet-tasting. It's used in brake fluids, paints, and lubricants, and is safe only in controlled industrial use. But if it contaminates other consumables, for example — pharmaceutical-grade ingredients, even in trace amounts, it becomes lethal — damaging the kidneys, liver, and nervous system.\n\nAs little as 1 ml per kilogram of body weight can be fatal. In case of adults, 50 to 100 ml can cause death, and for children, even a teaspoon can be fatal.\n\nAlso read | Cough syrup linked deaths: PIL seeks Supreme Court intervention as toll rises, MP bans 2 more drugs\n\nThe mortality rate ranges from 30% to 100%, depending on how quickly treatment begins.\n\nWhile propylene glycol is safe and widely used in medicines, cosmetics, and food, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol are industrial-grade chemicals and are lethal if consumed. As they look, taste, and behave similarly in manufacturing, DEG can slip in if the source material is adulterated — and that has resulted in repeated mass poisonings worldwide, said experts.\n\nExperts highlight that substitution often happens due to cost-cutting, poor supplier oversight, and lax testing, especially among smaller manufacturers. A stark example — in Indonesia, the cough syrups made by Afi Farma in 2022 contained up to 96–99% ethylene glycol. The company did not test its inputs and relied solely on supplier certificates. As a result, several children died.\n\nThis is not the first such tragedy. In 2020, 12 children died in Jammu \u0026 Kashmir. In 2022, at least 66 in Gambia and 18 in Uzbekistan.\n\nAnd now, the latest deaths in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are reportedly linked to contaminated syrups.\n\nExperts warned that unless India tightens raw material testing, ensures traceable supply chains, and enforces strict regulatory vigilance, toxic chemicals like DEG will continue to slip through, turning life-saving medicines into deadly poisons.(Edited by : Priyanka Rathi)",

The Tekton is the second product under Nissan’s “One Car, One World” strategy and will be manufactured in Chennai for India and global markets.\n\nSaurabh Vatsa, Managing Director, Nissan Motor in India, said, \"The All-New Nissan Tekton is going to be at the centre of Nissan’s resurgence story and offers a glimpse into the future of our product portfolio in the country... This model will spearhead Nissan’s growth story in India.\"\n\nThe front features a C-shaped LED daytime running light that wraps around horizontally positioned LED headlamps and connects across the width of the vehicle. The light bar is highlighted by twin chrome slats and the Nissan logo at the centre. A double C-shaped motif on the front fender represents the Himalayas. New Nissan Tekton\n\nThe rear continues the C-shaped theme with an edge-to-edge LED light bar linking angular tail-lamps. The side profile includes flared wheel arches and an upright stance, while the rear door handles are mounted on the pillars.\n\nNissan has not revealed the full interior yet, but it is expected to share the layout with the new Renault Duster, using different materials, chrome accents, and trims for a more premium look.\n\nTop variants are likely to feature an infotainment touchscreen, digital instrument cluster, 360-degree camera, rear AC vents, automatic climate control, and multiple drive modes. The infotainment system will share hardware with the Duster but use brand-specific software and UI.\n\nSafety is expected to include up to six airbags and driver-assistance systems, though it is unclear if ADAS tech from the international Duster will be included. New Nissan Tekton\n\nThe Tekton is expected to be powered by a 1.3-litre turbo-petrol engine producing 154 hp and 250 Nm, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Nissan has not confirmed if manual or AWD variants will be available at launch. A 7-seat version is planned by the end of FY2026, alongside the Renault-badged sibling.\n\nThe SUV will compete in the C-SUV segment, including the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, and Toyota Hyryder, and will sit above the Magnite in Nissan’s lineup.",

What is your source of livelihood?” Justice Kant also demanded official proof of his parentage, asking, “Who are you? What is your right? Please show us any official document declaring you as the father of the minors.”\n\n“What were you doing in Goa? Did you have any valid documents to stay in this country? You went to Nepal and extended your visa, and then again went to Goa,” he further asked.\n\n“What were you doing when your children were living in a cave?” asked Justice Bagchi.\n\nGoldstein's lawyer, Deepak Prakash, asked the court for more time to verify whether the children had already been sent back and to serve a copy of the petition to the Centre. The Supreme Court, however, refused to adjourn the matter and allowed Goldstein to withdraw his petition.\n\nEarlier, in July, Karnataka Police rescued 40-year-old Russian national Nina Kutina and her two daughters during a routine patrol in the Ramatirtha Hills forest in Gokarna, Kumta taluk. The family had been living in the forest for nearly two months without valid travel or residence documents. Following their rescue, they were sent to a Foreigners Restriction Centre for Women.\n\nOn September 28, Kutina, along with her two daughters and minor son, who was located separately in Goa, were flown back to Russia after being found living in India without valid documents.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "HomeIndia NewsFarmers in flood-hit Maharashtra say recovery may take up to five yearsFarmers across flood-hit districts of Maharashtra are grappling with massive crop losses and soil erosion that threaten their long-term livelihoods. While the state government has announced compensation and sought central assistance, many fear that relief measures may be delayed or insufficient to help them rebuild their farms and recover from the devastation.Torrential rains and severe flooding have left a trail of destruction across Maharashtra, with 31 out of the state’s 36 districts reeling under water. The floods have damaged crops spread over more than 50 lakh hectares, devastating the livelihoods of thousands of farmers who now fear a long and uncertain road to recovery.\n\nCrops such as cotton, soybean, oranges, pomegranate, maize, bajra, pulses, and onion have been hit the hardest. Many farmers say their fields have been rendered infertile due to soil erosion and the deposition of stones carried by the floodwaters.\n\n“Soybean’s cost of production is ₹50,000 per hectare. Had the rains not destroyed my crops, I would have earned at least ₹2 lakh,” said Rajendra Akolkar, a farmer from Ahilyanagar district, whose fields were submerged during the torrential downpour.\n\nThe Maharashtra government has said that crops across 31 districts have suffered extensive damage and that it has sanctioned compensation of over ₹2,000 crore for more than 31 lakh affected farmers. However, farmers in some of the worst-hit regions told CNBC-TV18 that the losses go far beyond crop destruction, with long-term impacts on soil fertility and productivity. “It will take us four to five years to recover,” said another farmer from Karanji village.\n\nWhile the state government maintains that the situation continues to remain grim, it has sought assistance from the Centre under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) quota. The opposition and farmer groups, however, are demanding that the government declare this a ‘wet drought’ year to ensure larger financial relief and policy support.\n\nThe state has initiated surveys to assess the extent of damage and determine the compensation to be paid, but the opposition alleges that the government is failing to act decisively. Meanwhile, many farmers fear that the aid, even if sanctioned, may be delayed or inadequate.\n\nWith farmlands still waterlogged and crops destroyed, Maharashtra’s agrarian economy faces a major setback. For many farmers, rebuilding their livelihoods and restoring their fields to productivity may take years—a recovery that, as they say, “won’t be easy or quick.”",

A red alert has been issued for Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri districts, while Darjeeling faces an orange alert. (Image: PTI)8 / 9Long-Term Causes | Experts and environmentalists have warned that human activities, including deforestation, unplanned construction, and poor drainage systems, have made Darjeeling’s fragile slopes highly vulnerable to landslides. They urged stricter enforcement of construction norms, climate-sensitive development, and decentralised disaster planning to prevent such tragedies in the future. (Image: PTI)9 / 9Historical Echoes | Sunday’s disaster echoes past tragedies, including the deadly 1968 deluge that killed nearly 1,000 people, highlighting the ongoing vulnerability of the region to extreme weather events intensified by climate change. Officials described the disaster as the worst since the 2015 landslides that killed nearly 40 people in the region. (Image: PTI)",

However, if the atmosphere of the state is impacted by your becoming a minister or holding a post of power, then we have to ensure that the scheme of justice prevails,\" the bench said.\n\nSibal said there was not a word in the April 28 order about Balaji becoming a minister and there can't be any injunction by the court on his becoming a minister while he is being prosecuted.\n\nJustice Kant questioned Sibal as to why the application for clarification was filed after apex court judge Justice Abhay S Oka, who asked him to resign as minister in Tamil Nadu government, has retired.\n\nRead more: Bihar Election Date 2025 Live Updates\n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Enforcement Directorate, also questioned the timing of the application and said that it was not in good taste.\n\nJustice Kant told Sibal, \"This court has not prevented you from taking over the post of the minister and it can't prevent you. But after it was found that on becoming minister just days after being granted bail, you were exercising some influence in the trial of cases, the court said it is better you go to jail\".\n\nSibal pointed out that maybe this was in the court's mind but it was not reflected from the order and hence this application was filed.\n\nJustice Bagchi said there were allegations of influence and the court found that these were prima facie correct.\n\nBoth Mehta and senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the victims of the scam, took the bench through sequence of orders passed in the matter and said that the court on April 23 gave an ultimatum to Balaji and asked him to make a choice \"between post and freedom\" as it warned him of cancelling bail if he did not step down as minister.\n\nSensing the mood of the court, Sibal sought permission to withdraw the plea.\n\nThe bench allowed him to withdraw the plea seeking clarification.\n\nIn another matter related to Balaji, where victims have approached the court seeking appointment of a special public prosecutor, the bench asked the Tamil Nadu government why these cash-for-job scam cases involving the former minister and state officials be not transferred to Delhi or some other neutral place.\nRead more: Cough syrup killing children: Maharashtra, Telangana flag Coldrif batches after deaths in MP, Rajasthan\n\nSenior advocates Abhishek Singhvi and Amit Anand Tiwari, appearing for the Tamil Nadu government, opposed the suggestion of the court saying that it will be a reflection on state judiciary that nothing is being done in these cases.\n\n\"We are only giving a suggestion that why not transfer the trial to Delhi or to some other neutral ground because the investigation is complete and only trial remains.

This is the court's suggestion because whenever a high state functionary or a minister is involved in criminal cases, allegations of influence or delay in trial are bound to be made,\" the bench said.\n\nSinghvi and Tiwari sought time to file their response on the issue saying the response of the accused needs to be seen on the issue of transfer of trial outside the state.\n\nSankaranarayanan submitted that when a former chief minister of the state was involved in a criminal case, the trial was shifted to Karnataka and the court can think on that line also.\n\nThe bench said it will look into it and took on record a chart of leading lawyers submitted by Sankaranarayanan for being appointed as special public prosecutors.\n\nIt also asked the state government counsels to submit some names who can be appointed as special public prosecutors.\n\nThe top court was hearing a petition filed by Y Balaji, challenging the March 28 Madras High Court order dismissing pleas against the clubbing of multiple chargesheets in cases related to the alleged scam.\n\nOn July 30, terming the trial involving Balaji a \"rudderless ship\", the top court said a cricket stadium will be needed to conduct prosecution in the cash-for-job scam related cases where over 2,000 people have been implicated as accused.\n\nRead more: Bihar elections: Voting in two phases on Nov 6 and 11, result on Nov 14, announces EC\n\nIt had pulled up the Tamil Nadu government for implicating so many persons as accused, questioned whether they are victims or victimisers and asked for the details of the accused and witnesses.\n\nThe top court had said it appears to be the most populated trial of India with 2,000 accused and 500 witnesses and that a small courtroom would not suffice.\n\nBalaji resigned from the M K Stalin-led state Cabinet on April 27 after being pulled up by the top court.\n\nOn April 23, the apex court took exception to the fact that Balaji was reinstated as a minister, days after he obtained bail in a money laundering case related to the alleged cash-for-jobs scam.\n\nOn September 26, 2024, the top court granted bail to Balaji in a case probed by the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nWith Balaji spending more than 15 months in jail, the top court had observed that there was no possibility that the trial would be concluded in the near future.",

Perhaps the beginning of a lifelong obsession, she would climb trees in her home and watch warplanes over the Burma front.\n\nDuring a period when women were expected to conform to predefined roles, Dhira was lucky to have a father, Kamaleshwar Chaliha, who supported her in following her dreams. Following her graduation from Guwahati's Handique College, Dhira noticed an advertisement in 1959 that would forever transform her life: the Assam Flying Club offered six fully-funded scholarships for pilot training.\nShe applied.\n\nDhira would practise flying in Tiger Moths and the indigenous Pushpak, two-seater propeller aircraft, twice a week. Each flight taught not only technical abilities but also courage, patience, and precision because there were no modern conveniences like sophisticated navigation or dependable radio contact.\n\nDhira Chaliha became the first female pilot of Assam when she earned her Pilot’s A Licence in April 1961, at the age of 21. Her solo flight was from Borjhar to Tezpur. While she was flying between Guwahati, Tezpur, Jorhat, and Shillong, the people of Azara gathered to watch her land.\n\nDespite the practical challenges she faced—such as difficult terrain and no radio communication—she mainly recalls the excitement.\n\nDhira had to make some sacrifices along the way. She wanted to become a commercial pilot, but her priorities changed when she married Kamal Hazarika and moved to London. Her decision to put her family before her profession was one that many women in her generation were forced to make.\n\nHowever, Dhira would continue going to flying clubs in London to tell everyone about her passion for flying.\n\nOver 60 years later, Dhira flew again over England in a Tiger Moth at the age of 85, marking one of the most poignant moments in her life. She flew over Berkshire and the River Thames with Captain John Towell at the controls.\n\nThis specific Tiger Moth was not a typical aircraft; it had been in Hollywood productions such as Thunderbirds and The King's Speech.\n\nAs the first woman pilot in Assam, Dhira is currently writing her autobiography, which will chronicle her years in the sky.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "The University of Western Australia will open campuses in Mumbai and Chennai, marking one of the first major foreign university entries into India’s $100-billion higher education market.The University of Western Australia (UWA), one of the Australia's prestigious Group of Eight (Go8) institutions, has announced plans to establish two campuses in India—one in Mumbai and another in Chennai—making it one of the first major foreign universities to enter the Indian higher education market after the government allowed international institutions to set up independent campuses.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC-TV18, Professor Guy Littlefair, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Education and Student Experience) at UWA, said the decision reflects the university’s long-term commitment to India’s rapidly expanding education sector and its potential to become a global hub for higher learning.\n\n“The University of Western Australia is looking at establishing two campuses, one in Mumbai and one in Chennai,” he said. “We absolutely believe we have an opportunity for students in India and from around the region to come to India and have a world-leading qualification.”\n\nProfessor Littlefair said India’s location and demographics make it one of the most significant regions for international education growth over the next two decades. “We will have to wait and see how India performs as an international education destination, but it is certainly going to be a hub,” he noted. “Given the policy changes by the University Grants Commission and the government’s decision to welcome foreign universities, we felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”\n\nHe added that UWA’s entry is not a short-term move but part of a broader strategy to build a sustained academic presence in India. “This is not for the short term, we are here for the long term,” he said. “We are looking to develop a comprehensive university offering programs across the arts, humanities, techno-sciences, and health.”\n\nIndia’s higher education market, estimated at around 100 billion dollars, has become increasingly attractive for global institutions. Professor Littlefair said UWA sees the move as both an academic and economic opportunity. “It is a big market for sure, and one that provides significant stimulus to the economy,” he said.\n\nExplaining the choice of cities, he said Mumbai represents India’s financial heart and has a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem, making it a natural location for the university’s expansion. Chennai, on the other hand, has a high demand for studies in engineering, computer science and the techno-sciences. “For us, setting up in both cities was an easy decision,” he said.\n\nUWA has already received a letter of intention from the University Grants Commission and is working towards establishing its physical presence in India. Professor Littlefair said the university anticipates opening its doors to students by August next year.\n\nThe university is still assessing whether to establish the campuses independently or through a joint venture with an Indian partner. “We are working through whether to set up as a joint venture or on our own. There are pros and cons on both sides,” he said. “Whatever happens, we will be delivering something significant here in India for students who are looking for such opportunities in the future.”\n\nHe also assured that the quality of education at the India campuses will match UWA’s standards in Australia. “We have to provide courses offshore to the same standard as those we provide in Australia,” he explained. “There will be some local nuances, but the offerings will be identical in quality.”\n\nUWA will focus strongly on student experience, offering a blend of classroom learning, field work, community engagement and research-based internships. “We focus on the student experience, not just in the classroom but through field work and community engagement,” he said. “We leverage our research expertise and offer internships and work-integrated learning.”\n\nWhile Professor Littlefair did not disclose the scale of investment, he confirmed that it would be substantial. “Establishing two campuses in a foreign country is a significant investment, but one that is well worth making,” he said. “We see nothing but great opportunity here in India.”\n\nWith this move, India’s goal of becoming a global education hub appears to be taking firm shape, as foreign universities begin to translate policy reforms into on-ground partnerships and campuses.",

    "title": "Sabarimala gold plating scandal: Kerala HC orders SIT probe; uproar in assembly",
    "content": "HomeIndia NewsSabarimala gold plating scandal: Kerala HC orders SIT probe; uproar in assemblyThe High Court Devaswom Bench has asked the SIT to keep the probe fully private and not reveal any information.The Kerala High Court on Monday, October 6, directed the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct a probe into the alleged theft of gold from the Sabarimala temple.\n\nLed by former Superintendent of Police S Sasidharan, the investigation will be overseen by Crime Branch chief Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) H Venkatesh and will consist of three inspectors, including cyber experts.\n\nThe High Court Devaswom Bench has asked the SIT to keep the probe fully private and not reveal any information. The order dates back to 2019, when the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) removed the gold-lined copper plates.\n\nThe problem worsened when Unnikrishnan Potty stated that two gold-plated panels presented to the temple in 2019 were stolen from the strongroom, right before the TDB-sponsored Global Ayyappa Sangamam event.\n\nRecently, IDB surveillance discovered the ‘missing’ goods; however, it was claimed that approximately 5 kg of weight was removed from the plates. According to Kerala Devaswom Minister V N Vasavan, the TDB vigilance will submit the report to the High Court on October 8.\n\nOver 5 kg of gold is missing from Sabarimala donations\n\nOn Monday, Congress MLA and Leader of Opposition in the Kerala Assembly, VD Satheesan, alleged that over 5 kilograms of gold donated by the UB Group and Vijay Mallya to the temple were misappropriated. He demanded a CBI probe under the supervision of the Kerala High Court.\n\nIn a conversation with ANI, he said, “This is a very serious matter... UB Group and Vijay Mallaya donated more than 30 kg of gold to the Sabarimala Temple for plating various things. Unfortunately, through some middlemen, more than 5kg of that gold was robbed.”\n\nMismatch between old and current gold-plated panels detected\n\nThe Devaswom Board Vigilance found that the gold-plated panels on the sanctum are different from the 2019 ones, possibly indicating the loss of panels plated with gold donated by Vijay Mallya, according to a report in Mathrubhumi. This conclusion was drawn from photographic comparisons and supported by a goldsmith's assessment.\n\nThe current gold-plated panels at the Sabarimala sanctum sanctorum do not match photographs of the panels from before July 2019. This suggests that the gold panels plated with Vijay Mallya's donated gold in 2019 may have gone missing.\n\nA goldsmith consulted during the inquiry also concluded that the panels are not the same. The vigilance intends to seek High Court permission for forensic tests to definitively determine the age and authenticity of the panels.\n\nUproar in Kerala Assembly \n\nEarlier in the day, the Kerala Legislative Assembly witnessed high drama as the Opposition created an uproar over the gold-plating controversy. During the Question Hour, Opposition leader VD Satheesan raised the issue and demanded the resignation of the Devaswom Minister and the Travancore Devaswom Board President.\n\nOpposition MLAs surrounded the Speaker's podium, carrying placards and banners with messages such as “Ayyappan's gold stolen, temple devoured by looters,” obstructing his vision. As the situation became serious, ministers and members of the ruling front stood up from their seats.\n\nAmid the ruckus, Speaker AN Shamseer cancelled Question Hour and momentarily adjourned the House. “Why disrupt the House without even giving a single notice?” he said.\n\nTDB Vigilance records statement of Unnikrishnan Potty\n\nOn Sunday, the TDB Vigilance recorded the statement of the former helper and the sponsor of gold-plating works at Sabarimala, Unnikrishnan Potty. He was questioned for nearly three hours at the headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nIn response to the media's questions, he said, \"Don't I have freedom as an individual? Everything will be proven before the High Court. Don't I have the right to move freely? The truth will prevail.”\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu to visit Sabarimala temple\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu is scheduled to visit the temple on the concluding day of the Thulamasa Pooja on October 22. She is set to be in Kerala for a two-day visit, till October 24, and attend several programmes in the Thiruvananthapuram and Kottayam areas.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "HomeIndia NewsNamma Metro: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah proposes renaming it 'Basava Metro'; netizens reactOn Sunday, Siddaramaiah recommended renaming the Namma Metro to \"Basava Metro\" in honour of 12th-century social reformer Basavanna.Bengaluru's famed metro train network may soon witness a significant change as Chief Minister Siddaramaiah announced plans to rename Namma Metro.\n\nOn Sunday, Siddaramaiah recommended renaming the Namma Metro to ‘Basava Metro’ in honour of 12th-century social reformer Basavanna. During a public gathering on October 5, the Chief Minister stated that he would forward the proposal to the Central government.\n\nOn X, Siddaramaiah stated that if it were a totally state government project, he would have announced it as such right away.\n\n“I will recommend to the central government to name our metro as ‘Basava Metro.’ If this were entirely a state government project, I would have announced it as ‘Basava Metro’ today itself. We have many castes and many religions among us. In the Chaturvarna system, we are placed in the fourth position. Regardless of which caste Shudras belong to, we must realise that we are all one,” he wrote on X.\n\nCM Siddaramaiah further mentioned that he was an admirer of Basavanna, adding, “My belief is that Basava's principles are eternal and relevant--not just in the past, not just today, but forever.”\nನಮ್ಮ ಮೆಟ್ರೋಗೆ \"ಬಸವ ಮೆಟ್ರೋ\" ಎಂದು ನಾಮಕರಣ ಮಾಡುವ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಕೇಂದ್ರಕ್ಕೆ ಶಿಫಾರಸ್ಸು ಮಾಡುತ್ತೇನೆ. ಇದು ಪೂರ್ಣವಾಗಿ ರಾಜ್ಯ ಸರ್ಕಾರದ ಯೋಜನೆ ಆಗಿದ್ದರೆ ಇವತ್ತೇ \"ಬಸವ ಮೆಟ್ರೋ\" ಎಂದು ಘೋಷಿಸಿ ಬಿಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದೆ.\nನಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ ಅನೇಕ ಜಾತಿ, ಅನೇಕ‌ ಧರ್ಮಗಳಿವೆ. ಚಾತುವರ್ಣ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಾಲ್ಕನೇ ಸ್ಥಾನದಲ್ಲಿ ಇರುವವರು ನಾವು. ಶೂದ್ರರು ಜಾತಿ… pic.twitter.com/k5yUD34UaA\n\n— Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) October 5, 2025\n\nThe proposal triggered widespread public discussion, with some Bengalureans arguing that the name was a cherished part of the city's identity and should not be changed.\nMany argued that instead of renaming infrastructure projects, the government should prioritise practical issues like expediting under-construction metro lines and reducing peak-hour congestion.\n\n“Our metro's name is nice. If we want to name it after Basavanna, we should name a new station after him,” a user wrote in the comment section.\n\nAnother said, “Namma Metro Name is Enough for our Metro. Instead of doing this, focus on developing the city where Basavanna was born.”\n\n“Why didn't you then name your children \u0026 and grandchildren to honour Basavanna. Pls stop the appeasement politics. Why can't it be Namma Metro? It's funded by people’s tax, which goes to the State coffers. You haven't paid it from your own pockets,” the third user posted.\n\n“Repair Bengaluru roads first. People are falling and getting hurt. Taking care of citizens should be your top priorities. We are paying huge taxes. Where is going???” a user wrote. “Bengalureans should oppose this. Namma Metro is an iconic name, it should remain as it is,” one user commented.\n\n“First reduce metro ticket prices, then think about renaming it,” another said.\n\nThis is not the first time a name change related to Bengaluru's metro has stirred debate. A proposal in September 2025 to rename the Shivajinagar Metro station after St. Mary's caused a political controversy. Announcing the plans, Siddaramaiah stated the state would announce it’s renaming once the central government approves.\n\nAt the annual feast of St Mary’s Basilica on September 8, he said, “There is a proposal to name a metro station after St. Mary. Rizwan and I have spoken about it because Rizwan is the MLA of this constituency. I will make a recommendation to the central government.” The announcement had triggered a political storm, with many strongly objecting to the move.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

    "content": "HomeIndia NewsHealthcare NewsIndia to revise CGHS rates from October 13: What may change for hospitals and beneficiariesCGHS offers cashless medical treatment to central government employees, pensioners, and their dependents.The government has approved a comprehensive revision of rates under the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), marking the first major overhaul in close to 15 years. The updated pricing, covering nearly 2,000 medical procedures, will come into effect on October 13.\n\nCGHS offers cashless medical treatment to central government employees, pensioners, and their dependents.\n\nThe revised framework introduces a multidimensional pricing structure, with rates now linked to hospital accreditation status, facility type, city classification, and ward entitlement.\n\nUnder the new system, National Accreditation Board for Hospitals (NABH) or National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)-accredited hospitals will serve as the benchmark for base rates. Non-accredited hospitals will receive 15% lower reimbursements. Super-specialty hospitals will be eligible for 15% higher rates, while facilities in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities will be compensated at 10–20% below metro-level pricing.\n\nHospitals had been seeking an upward revision for several years, arguing that package rates—unchanged since 2014—had failed to keep pace with medical inflation.\n\nIn several instances, healthcare providers had either delayed or declined cashless CGHS treatments due to viability concerns.\n\nAnalysts estimate that the revised schedule translates into an average increase of 25–30% across high-volume procedures, with super-specialty centres receiving an additional 15% premium over standard NABH-linked rates.\n\nListed healthcare chains such as Max Healthcare, Narayana Health, Yatharth Hospitals, and Fortis are among those with higher exposure to CGHS patients and are therefore expected to see financial gains.\n\nSector experts say the move is likely to strengthen cash flows for Tier-1 and super-specialty hospitals, although timely settlement of dues will remain critical as the revised structure is rolled out.",

    "title": "Harvest Moon 2025: Why it’s in October instead of September this year",
    "content": "While the Harvest Moon typically appears in September, it can sometimes fall in early October. The timing depends not on the month itself, but on which full moon is closest to the autumn equinox.The Harvest Moon of 2025 will light up the skies tonight, October 6, marking one of the brightest and most beautiful full moons of the year. Interestingly, this year’s Harvest Moon is appearing in October, not September – a rare but completely natural occurrence. Here’s why it happens and what makes it special.\n\nWhat Is the Harvest Moon?\n\nThe Harvest Moon is the name given to the full moon that occurs closest to the autumnal equinox, typically falling around September 22.\n\nCenturies ago, this moon provided extra evening light to farmers harvesting their crops, helping them work later into the night. Over time, it became known as the Harvest Moon – a symbol of abundance and the changing of seasons.\n\nWhy is it in October in 2025?\n\nWhile the Harvest Moon typically appears in September, it can sometimes fall in early October. The timing depends not on the month itself, but on which full moon is closest to the autumn equinox.\n\nIn 2025, the September full moon occurred on September 7, nearly two weeks before the equinox – too early to earn the title. The next full moon, on October 6, occurs just after the equinox, making it the closest one and officially the Harvest Moon of 2025.\nThis shift happens due to the Moon’s 29.5-day orbit and the slight variations in how its cycle aligns with the solar calendar each year. These natural adjustments occasionally push the Harvest Moon into October, as they did this year.\n\nHistorically, an October Harvest Moon is rare, and based on current lunar-solar cycle patterns, such October occurrences typically repeat every two to three years. The last time one occurred was in 2020, and astronomical forecasts suggest the next October Harvest Moon will be in 2028.\n\nA Rare Supermoon Appearance\n\nAdding to the excitement, tonight’s Harvest Moon is also a supermoon – meaning it occurs when the Moon is near its closest point to Earth in its orbit.\n\nDue to this proximity, the Moon will appear larger and brighter than usual, glowing with a warm golden hue as it rises over the horizon. Stargazers can expect a breathtaking view shortly after sunset.\n\nWhen and How to Watch the Harvest Moon Tonight\n\nThe Harvest Moon will rise around sunset on Monday, October 6, and stay visible through the night.\n\nFor the best viewing experience:\n \tLook toward the eastern horizon just after sunset.\n \tChoose a clear, open area away from artificial lights.\n \tThe Moon will appear especially golden or orange when it is low in the sky, gradually becoming brighter as it rises higher.\n\nViewers across India, Europe, and North America should have excellent visibility, weather permitting.(Edited by : Priyanka Deshpande)",

    "content": "Maserati has launched the MCPura supercar in India, offering Coupe and Cielo variants with a 3.0L V6 engine, top speed of 325 km/h, and prices starting at ₹4.12 crore.1 / 7Maserati Debuts: Italian automaker Maserati recently launched the MC Pura in India. The supercar is available in two variants: the hardtop Coupe and the open-roof Cielo. The Coupe starts at ₹4.12 crore, while the Cielo is priced at Rs 5.12 crore (ex-showroom). Both models are powered by a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine and are mechanically identical to their international counterparts.2 / 7Design Updates: The MC Pura retains the MC20 silhouette but features design updates. The grille has a dark surround, and the front splitter is modified. Air intakes below the headlamps are larger. At the rear, the bumper has subtle refinements. Maserati worked with Dallara to enhance the car’s aerodynamic efficiency. The coupe has a matte finish, while the convertible has a glossy finish.3 / 7Signature Badging: Exterior branding receives a visual update. The Trident emblems on the grille and C-pillar, MCPura lettering on the flanks, and wheel center caps feature magenta with blue mica particles. Glossy finishes appear on the coupe, while matte finishes highlight the Cielo. The badges contrast against the body paint, giving the supercars a distinct visual identity compared to the MC20.4 / 7Engine Performance: Both variants use the 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged Nettuno V6, producing 621 horsepower and 719–730 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The Coupe accelerates from 0–100 km/h in 2.9 seconds, while the Cielo does it in 3.0 seconds. Both reach a top speed of 325 km/h.5 / 7Interior Features: The MCPura cabin follows the MC20 layout with new touches. Seats feature laser-etched Alcantara with vertical striping and contrasting red and blue tones. The dashboard has a digital instrument cluster, central touchscreen, and three-spoke steering wheel with engine start/stop and shift paddles. Carbon fibre trims line the cabin. The Cielo has matte detailing, while the Coupe features glossy interior accents.6 / 7Maserati MCPura7 / 7Model Evolution: The MCPura replaces the MC20 in India. Its global debut occurred at the Goodwood Festival of Speed earlier this year. The MCPura is an evolution of the MC20 with subtle styling changes and a refreshed paint palette. Mechanically, both models remain unchanged. The Cielo convertible is priced ₹19 lakh lower than the MC20 Cielo available in India since May.",

We are not distracted. These things do not affect me,\" Justice Gavai was quoted as saying by Bar and Bench.\nThe incident was possibly linked with CJI Gavai's earlier remarks in a case related to the restoration of the Lord Vishnu idol at the Khajuraho group of temples.\n\n\"Go and ask the deity itself to do something now. You say you are a staunch devotee of Lord Vishnu. So go and pray now. It’s an archaeological site and ASI needs to give permission etc,\" CJI Gavai had reportedly remarked while dismissing the plea, as per B\u0026B.\n\nHis remarks, however, led to a controversy on social media after the remarks were widely shared, alleging that the statement hurt religious sentiments.\n\nLater, the CJI had clarified that he respects all religions and did not mean to hurt the sentiments of any community. \"I respect all religions,\" CJI Gavai had said.\n\nThe Supreme Court's security unit initiated an inquiry into the attack incident, as per a news agency PTI.\n\nFormer secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Advocate Rohit Pandey criticised the act and called for action in the case. \"Today's incident is a very sad one. If a lawyer has committed or attempted to commit assault in a court, we strongly condemn it. He is a member of our bar. We recently inquired and found out that he is a member of the 2011 Bar. But it is a very sad incident,\" Pandey told news agency ANI.\n\n\"He (the lawyer) attempted this based on the comment made by the CJI in the case of a Lord Vishnu matter. This is a very sad incident. We strongly condemn this, and if this incident is true, action should be taken,\" he added.\n\nFurther details are awaited in the matter.First Published: Oct 6, 2025 1:24 PM IST",

    "content": "NASA said the supermoon will dominate the sky on Monday, October 6, the night the Draconid meteor shower is expected to start.The first supermoon of 2025 will be visible to skywatchers worldwide on the night of October 6 as the Harvest Moon reaches its closest and fullest point, appearing up to 30% brighter and 14% bigger than a normal full moon.\n\nThis particular lunar spectacle expands as the Harvest Moon — the full moon that falls closest to the autumnal equinox (this year on September 22) — a traditional marker in various cultures for the harvesting season.\n\nAccording to NASA, the supermoon will dominate the sky on October 6, the night the Draconid meteor shower is expected to start. However, the Harvest Moon in October might be too bright for people to appreciate the meteor shower completely.\n\nTiming and Viewing Tips\n\nThe Harvest Supermoon will rise in the eastern sky on Monday, October 6, at 6:55 pm ET and set at 8:05 am ET the following day. Additionally, the moon will be full when it rises at 7:28 pm ET on Tuesday.\n\nThe full moon is predicted to achieve its maximum brightness around 11:48 pm ET on October 6 (early October 7 in UTC). Beginning on the evening of October 5 and continuing through October 7, the moon will be nearly full in many locations.\n\nExperts advise viewing the Moon shortly after moonrise or close to moonset, when it is low on the horizon and its shape looks exaggerated due to an atmospheric phenomenon called the ‘moon illusion,’ for the most dramatic views.\n\nLook for a spot with an open view; fields, parks, and waterfronts are excellent spots to observe the scenery.\n\nIt is advised to use a tripod for photography. Consider adding foreground objects (trees, buildings) to provide a sense of scale, and use slower exposures to prevent overexposure of the bright lunar disc.\n\nWhy It Happens\n\nA ‘supermoon’ happens when the moon is both full and close to perigee, the point in its elliptical orbit that comes closest to Earth. Although the change is barely noticeable for many casual observers, the moon may appear substantially bigger and brighter than usual due to its proximity.\n\nThe moon will come close to Earth during the most recent viewing, approximately 224,600 miles (361,459 km) away. Three supermoons in 2025 will follow after this one, with the following two being on November 5 (Beaver Supermoon) and December 4 (Cold Moon Supermoon).\n\nTwo lunar eclipses will occur in 2026: A total eclipse in March that will be visible from most of North America, Asia, and Australia, and a partial eclipse in August that will be visible from the Americas, Africa, and Europe.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

Multiple teams are looking for the accused,” the officer added.\n\nIn a similar case reported in August, a 24-year-old woman was alleged to have been gang raped by four men at a party in north Delhi's Civil Lines.\n\nThe victim had alleged that a male friend had invited her to a party at a friend’s house, where the accused spiked her drinks and raped her.(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani)",

Several radar systems, command and control units, and air defence installations were also hit in targeted missile strikes across multiple airbases.\nOne of the most significant hits occurred at PAF Bholari Airbase, where an F-16 jet parked in a hangar was destroyed, resulting in the death of five PAF personnel, including a Squadron Leader and Chief Technician. The AWACS Erieye, also hit at Bholari, was later repaired by US Air Force engineers flown in urgently.\nFurther damage was reported at:\nPAF Shahbaz Air Base (Jacobabad) – Two F-16s destroyed in hangars\nNur Khan Airbase (Rawalpindi) – One F-16 and a C-130 hit in a precision strike\nSarghodha, Rahim Yar Khan, and Mushaf Airbase – Infrastructure like runways, hangars, and communication systems severely damaged.\nHigh-level Pakistani defence sources revealed that $400–$470 million in secret emergency funds were approved in late May for repairs and upgrades. The United States reportedly blocked China from assisting in the repairs over concerns of technology theft, particularly related to the F-16s and C-130 aircraft.\nTo expedite repairs, the US dispatched special teams from Al-Udeid Airbase (Doha), Al Dhafra (Abu Dhabi), and Bethesda (Maryland) after Field Marshal Asim Munir personally requested help during meetings with US President Donald Trump and retired CENTCOM Chief Michael Kurilla.\nMultiple US military flights (C-17s and C-130s) were tracked landing at Nur Khan Airbase between June and September, confirming covert US activity on Pakistani soil. The US support was further acknowledged when Pakistan awarded General Kurilla its highest military honour in July 2025.\nWhile most damage has now been repaired, sources indicate Rahim Yar Khan’s airbase runway remains out of service due to ongoing flooding in South Punjab. PAF is also fast-tracking upgrades with a hybrid American-Chinese satellite-integrated radar system, intended to prevent future vulnerabilities.\nThe revelation underscores the scale, precision, and aftermath of Operation Sindoor, which inflicted strategic damage to Pakistan’s air capabilities and revealed Islamabad’s growing reliance on US military assistance despite rising Chinese collaboration.",

    "title": "Planning to buy a house: 5 hidden costs that can raise your total price",
    "content": "Buying a home? The price per square foot isn’t the full story. Stamp duty, GST, maintenance, parking, and legal fees can add 10–12% to your total cost.1 / 7Planning a House: The price per square foot is often the first figure buyers look at when considering a home. But this is not the complete picture. Several extra charges come along with the purchase, and they can raise the total cost by around 10 to 12%. (Image: Pixabay)2 / 7Stamp Duty Costs: One of the largest expenses is stamp duty and registration. This varies by state, usually falling between 5 and 7% of the agreement value. For example, on a flat priced at ₹1 crore, stamp duty and registration will cost an additional ₹5–7 lakh, which must be paid upfront. (Image: Pixabay)3 / 7GST on Homes: Goods and Services Tax (GST) also applies in certain cases. Ready-to-move-in homes are free from GST. However, if the property is under construction, buyers must pay 5% GST. For affordable housing projects, the rate is lower, at 1%. (Image: Pixabay)4 / 7Maintenance Charges: Builders usually collect advance maintenance charges covering one to two years. These payments go toward upkeep of amenities like lifts, clubhouse, security, and landscaping. In addition, buyers are asked to contribute to a one-time corpus fund, which serves as a reserve for the future needs of the housing society. (Image: Pixabay)5 / 7Parking and Floors: Parking spaces and floor-rise charges are separate from the base price of the property. Covered parking slots and apartments on higher floors usually come at a premium. In metro cities, these add-ons can amount to several lakhs, making a notable difference in the final payable amount. (Image: Pixabay)6 / 7Legal and Brokerage: Legal and brokerage expenses are another component. Even when dealing directly with developers, buyers should expect to spend around 1% of the property value on brokerage fees. In addition, legal verification of documents generally costs between ₹25,000 and ₹50,000. (Image: Pixabay)7 / 7Final Price Check: When setting a budget for property purchase, it is important not to rely only on the builder’s quoted rate. By adding a buffer of 10 to 12% for stamp duty, taxes, charges, and fees, buyers will have a clearer view of the actual financial requirement. In real estate, the headline price is rarely the final cost. (Image: Pixabay)",

Companies cited price competition from overseas providers as a key factor restraining growth in foreign sales.\n\nStill, business confidence regarding the year ahead improved to a six-month high. Firms cited planned advertising campaigns, expected efficiency gains, competitive pricing strategies and anticipated tax cuts as reasons for optimism.\n\nHowever, employment growth maintained a modest pace in September, with fewer than 5% of surveyed companies reporting new hiring.\n\nBoth input cost pressures and price increases charged by service providers eased from August. Firms passed on extra costs to their consumers at the shallowest rate since March.\n\nIndia's inflation rose in August to 2.07% from July's 1.61%, ending a nine-month streak of decline. But it was well within the Reserve Bank of India's target range of 2-6%.

    "content": "In the backdrop of recent concerns over the quality and use of cough syrups, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Sunday, October 5, convened a high-level review meeting with all States and Union Territories (UT) under the chairmanship of Union Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava.\n\nThe meeting reviewed compliance with drug quality norms, particularly the Revised Schedule M for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and discussed measures to promote rational use of cough syrups, especially in paediatric populations, said a press statement from the union health ministry.\n\nThe review was held following directions from Union Health Minister JP Nadda, who had earlier instructed that States and UTs be engaged to ensure all necessary actions are taken promptly to prevent any recurrence of safety lapses.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Amit Agarwal, Secretary, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers; Dr Rajiv Bahl, Secretary, Department of Health Research and DG, ICMR; Dr Sunita Sharma, Director General of Health Services (DGHS); Dr Rajeev Raghuvanshi, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI); and Dr Ranjan Das, Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nSenior health and drug control officials from all States and UTs, including Additional Chief Secretaries, Principal Secretaries, Drug Controllers, and NHM Mission Directors, also participated.\n\nKey Focus Areas\n\nThe discussions centred around three critical agenda points:\n \tCompliance with Schedule M and other GSR provisions relating to quality standards in drug manufacturing units;\n \tRational use of cough syrups in children, avoiding irrational combinations and inappropriate formulations; and\n \tStrengthening retail pharmacy regulation to prevent misuse and over-the-counter sales of such formulations.\n\nInvestigation Findings from Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh\n\nThe meeting follows reports of child deaths in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, allegedly linked to contaminated cough syrups. The Metropolitan Surveillance Unit (MSU), Nagpur, established under the Pradhan Mantri–Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM), had reported a cluster of cases and deaths from a block in Chhindwara district to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and the NCDC.\n\nTaking note of the reports, a Central expert team comprising epidemiologists, microbiologists, entomologists and drug inspectors from NCDC, National Institute of Virology (NIV) and Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) visited Chhindwara and Nagpur to investigate the situation in coordination with Madhya Pradesh authorities, said the statement.\n\nThe team collected clinical, environmental, entomological, and drug samples, which were sent to NIV Pune, Central Drug Laboratory (CDL) Mumbai, and NEERI Nagpur for analysis.\n\nPreliminary findings ruled out common infectious diseases, except for one positive case of Leptospirosis. Nineteen medicine samples consumed by affected children were collected from treating private practitioners and nearby retail outlets.\n\nChemical analysis of ten samples completed so far showed that nine met the required quality standards, while one cough syrup, “Coldrif,” contained diethylene glycol (DEG) beyond permissible limits.\n\nFollowing this finding, Tamil Nadu FDA—where the manufacturing unit is located in Kancheepuram—has initiated regulatory action, including cancellation of the manufacturing licence as recommended by CDSCO, and criminal proceedings have also been launched, the statement said.\n\nCentre’s Directive: Zero Tolerance for Non-Compliance\n\nUnion Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava emphasised strict adherence to the Revised Schedule M by all drug manufacturers. She directed States to undertake a thorough identification of non-compliant units and take strict punitive action where required.\n\nShe also urged States to ensure rational use of cough syrups, particularly in children, “as most coughs are self-limiting and do not require pharmacological treatment.” The advisory issued earlier by the DGHS on the rational use of cough syrups in paediatric populations was discussed during the meeting.\n\nSrivastava also stressed enhanced surveillance and early reporting:\n“States and UTs must ensure timely reporting by all health facilities, both government and private, and ensure wide dissemination of the community reporting tool of IDSP-IHIP. Inter-state coordination must be strengthened for early reporting and joint action,” she said.\n\nRisk-Based Inspections and GMP Upgradation\n\nThe Health Ministry informed that Risk-Based Inspections (RBI) have been initiated across 19 manufacturing units in six States to identify systemic gaps and strengthen quality assurance mechanisms.\n\nDr Rajeev Raghuvanshi, DCGI, reiterated the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to strictly comply with the revised GMP standards under Schedule M. He noted that certain firms applying for infrastructure upgradation under the government’s scheme have been granted an extension till December 2025, but urged States to ensure these norms are implemented without delay.\n\nThe Department of Pharmaceuticals informed that several drug units have already begun availing support under the Revamped Pharmaceuticals Technology Upgradation Assistance Scheme (RPTUAS) for GMP upgradation.\n\nExperts Warn Against Cough Syrup Overuse in Children\n\nDr Rajiv Bahl, Secretary, Department of Health Research and DG, ICMR, emphasised that children should not be prescribed cough syrups or any combination drugs to avoid side effects.\n\n“The National Joint Outbreak Response Team is already functional and ensures effective coordination between NCDC, ICMR and other central agencies. States must strengthen coordination between their own agencies for rapid response to any health emergency,” he said.\n\nDr Sunita Sharma, DGHS, underlined that cough medications provide minimal proven benefit in children but can pose significant risks.\n\n“We must check all formulations carefully to avoid combined overdoses and verify the concentration of active ingredients,” she said, adding that guidelines for doctors, pharmacists and parents on the rational use of paediatric cough syrups will soon be issued to States.\n\nState Updates\n\nSeveral States shared their updates and findings during the meeting.\n\nRajasthan’s Principal Secretary (Health) informed that investigations so far indicate the four child deaths reported were not linked to cough syrup quality, though awareness campaigns are being conducted on rational paediatric drug use. “By way of abundant caution, various regulatory actions have been taken and further investigations are underway,” the official said.\n\nAlso Read: Maharashtra FDA issues ‘stop use’ alert for Coldrif syrup batch linked to child deaths\n\nMaharashtra’s Secretary, Medical Education, reported that children admitted in Nagpur hospitals “are being treated with the best possible health care.”\n\nStates and UTs also apprised the Centre of their initiatives to strengthen drug quality control systems, enhance surveillance, and adopt best practices in pharmacovigilance and community awareness.\n\nCentre Reaffirms Commitment to Patient Safety\n\nConcluding the meeting, the Health Secretary reiterated the importance of enhanced surveillance, timely data sharing, and cross-border coordination among States.\n\nThe Ministry reaffirmed its zero-tolerance policy toward substandard drugs and its commitment to ensuring the highest standards of drug quality and patient safety.\n\n“Swift, coordinated, and sustained action is essential to prevent recurrence of such incidents,” the Ministry said in a statement.",

A number of Assamese community people living there and the singer had been on a yacht trip. He had gone to the Southeast Asian nation to attend the 4th edition of the North East India Festival, organised by Shyamkanu Mahanta and his company.\n\n”Our entire concern now is whether the people living in Singapore will come or not. If they do not come, we will not be able to complete the inquiry. They were the main people behind the yacht trip,” Sarma told reporters after meeting Garg’s family here on Saturday.\n\n”Assam Police cannot go to Singapore, so it cannot take up the investigation there. They (Assamese community people) are in Singapore, and it is not under my jurisdiction. Unless they come there, nobody will be able to join the dots,” he said.\n\nThe state CID, which is probing the death of the singer, had issued notices to some members of the Assam Association, Singapore, to present themselves before it by October 6.\n\n”Their parents stay in Assam. So, we, the people of Assam, must put pressure on the parents to ask their wards to come here for the probe,” the CM added.\n\nMore than 60 FIRs have been lodged across the state against Shyamkanu Mahanta, and around 10 others, including his manager Siddharth Sharma and band members Shekhar Jyoti Goswami and Amrit Prabha Mahanta.\n\nThese four individuals have already been arrested in the case and are serving 14 days of police remand each.\n\nSarma said, ”The people of Assam should put pressure on the Assamese community of Singapore so that those concerned are sent here. A few of them have already written to us that they cannot come due to some problems. But they have the responsibility as an Assamese.” To bring the people concerned through law is a different matter, but it will be sooner if there is public pressure on them, he added.\n\n”If they don’t come by October 6, we will have to enter another cycle,” Sarma said without elaborating.\n\nWhen asked about reports of Garg’s drummer Goswami’s claim before the police that the singer was poisoned, the CM said that many things will be spoken about during the course of the investigation.\n\n”On October 10, the viscera report will come. So, we will come to know on October 11 what actually happened. But the police’s duty is to note everything in the case diary.\n\nSarma stressed that the poisoning statement is not of the police, but of one accused.\n\n”Now, why has he made that statement? Is it to safeguard himself or to blame someone else — these things will be revealed during the investigation,” he added.\n\nThe Assam government on Friday set up a one-man judicial commission, headed by Justice Soumitra Saikia of the Gauhati High Court, to probe the death of Garg, a cultural icon of the state.\n\nThe chief minister said that the sitting high court judge will also have an opportunity to oversee the ongoing CID probe of the high-profile case.\n\n”It is a kind of body which will also take care of the proofs, and if they find that we are doing something wrong, the judicial commission will be able to be stricter on us. It will be a completely independent commission,” Sarma said.\n\nHe also asserted that in Assam, a sitting judge had never been entrusted with the responsibility of inquiring into an issue.",

One mill may have to contribute about ₹25 lakh to the CMRF. We are seeking funds from the profits of sugar mills, not from farmers.\" He slammed those criticising the decision, saying they were misinterpreting it.\n\"Some people have stooped so low that they are portraying this as the government taking money from farmers.

The NIA took over the probe a few days later, on April 12.\n\nSidhu, an operative of the proscribed terrorist organisation Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), along with his associate Manish, formed a terror gang to target prominent leaders of Punjab to create a climate of fear among the people and raise funds for the BKI through extortion, a statement issued by the NIA said.\n\nManish had subsequently recruited Ameen, who had hurled the grenade at the former minister’s house, it said. The grenade was supplied to Ameen by Sidhu, while Jangra provided the funds, the probe agency said.\n\nSidhu had circulated a poster after the attack, claiming responsibility for hatching the conspiracy along with Manish, it said.\n\nA red corner notice has been issued against Sidhu, who is also carrying a reward of ₹10 lakh on his arrest.\n\nThe NIA had earlier chargesheeted Sidhu in a case related to the targeted killing of Punjab-based VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) leader Vikas Prabhakar in April 2024.\n\nThe anti-terror agency has intensified its efforts to track and arrest the absconders and identify other members of BKI operating in India, the statement said.",

Those users who opt for Unified Payment Interface (UPI) will have to pay 1.25 times the applicable fee depending on the category of the vehicle.\n\nAlso read | No need for electric vehicles to pay toll on these three major express roads in Maharashtra\n\nFor example, if a vehicle with a valid FASTag pays ₹100 as user fee at a toll plaza, those without a functional FASTag will need to pay ₹200 if they are making the payment via cash. If they use UPI, the amount to be paid will be ₹125.\n\nImpact of the move\n\nThe amended rule is expected to expedite the fee collection process on national highways, promote ease of commuting and improve transparency in toll collection. Earlier, both UPI and cash users without a valid FASTag had to pay double the applicable user fee. The change in the rules would lead to faster travel time at toll plazas and shorter queues, as per reports. It would encourage more travellers to opt for FASTags as that remains the cheapest option for toll collection.\n\nAlso read | FASTag toll collection jumps 19.6% to ₹20,681 crore in Q1; users up 16.2%\n\nStarting November 15, UPI will be an attractive payment option for non-FASTag users, given that it will be cheaper than paying cash and would incentivise digital payments with the government's policies to adopt technology.(Edited by : Jerome Anthony)",

Only 54 students were enrolled in IGP and other courses.\n\nThis deliberate concealment of important information misled aspirants and parents into believing that Drishti IAS was responsible for their success in all stages of the UPSC examination, which is a misleading advertisement under Section 2(28) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nCCPA also noted that this is the second penalty imposed on Drishti IAS for similar conduct. Earlier, in September 2024, the authority had passed a final order against Drishti IAS for its misleading claim of ”150+ selections in UPSC CSE 2021”.\n\nThe institute submitted the details of 161 candidates, exceeding its claim of 150+ selections in UPSC CSE 2021.\n\nIn that case too, it was found that out of these 161 candidates, 148 were enrolled in IGP, seven were enrolled in Mains Mentorship Program, four were enrolled in GS Foundation Program, one in Optional course and the details of the remaining one candidate were not mentioned.\n\nThe CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹3 lakh and directed the discontinuation of the misleading advertisement.\n\nDespite being penalised and cautioned earlier, Drishti IAS once again indulged in the same practice for the 2022 examination results by enhancing its claim to ”216+ selections”, thereby showing repeated non-compliance and disregard for consumer protection norms.\n\nThe concealment of such crucial information deprived prospective students and parents of their right to make an informed choice, as per Section 2(9) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\n”Such advertisements create false expectations and unfairly influence consumer decisions, particularly when large claims are made without transparent disclosure of facts,” the ministry said.\n\nSo far, the CCPA has issued 54 notices to various coaching institutes for misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices. Penalties amounting to over ₹90.6 lakh have been imposed on 26 coaching institutes, along with directions to discontinue such misleading claims.\n\nThe CCPA noted that all such institutes concealed important information regarding the courses opted for by successful candidates in their advertisements, which amounts to misleading advertisements under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThe authority has emphasised that all coaching institutes must strictly ensure truthful disclosure of information in their advertisements so that students can make fair and informed decisions regarding their academic choices.",

Krishnan: New online gaming rules bring clarity, authority to be operational from day oneThe draft online gaming rules aim to bring clarity for industry players while safeguarding users, MeitY Secretary S. Krishnan said. Registration is mandatory for e-sports but voluntary for social games, with banks allowed to return user funds. He added that the new Online Gaming Authority will be active from day one, while the ECM scheme has drawn overwhelming industry response.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has released draft rules for online gaming, aimed at bringing regulatory clarity while supporting innovation in the sector. In an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18, MeitY Secretary S. Krishnan explained key provisions, stressing that the framework is designed to safeguard users while enabling ease of doing business for developers.On the release of the draft online gaming rules\nKrishnan dismissed the idea of a staggered rollout, noting that the legislation was passed swiftly in Parliament and the rules were framed after extensive consultation with industry.\n“Most of the industry has accepted the spirit of the law and stopped offering many of the money games defined under it. The rules are fairly straightforward, and we want to give the industry enough time to respond,” he said.\nOn registration requirements\nHe clarified that registration is not mandatory for online social games.\n“Registration of an online social game is voluntary. This is a major ease of doing business step for startups and innovators, ensuring that small or educational games don’t face regulatory burden,” Krishnan added. By contrast, e-sports will require registration under the new framework.\nOn enabling banks to return user deposits\nAddressing industry concerns on refunds, Krishnan said the Act was not designed to penalise players.\n“The intent is to treat them more as victims. That’s why clarity has been provided to banks that they can return deposits or money collected without violating the law,” he noted.\nOn subscription vs reward models\nWhile subscription-based revenue is permissible, reward-based models will require closer scrutiny.\n“The subscription system is clearly covered in the Act. Reward systems will have to be examined, case by case, by the authority, depending on their nature,” he said.\nOn Online Gaming Authority\nKrishnan emphasised that the proposed authority will be ready to function immediately.\n“We’ve kept it lean and digital so it can be operational from day one of the rules being notified. Officials are in place, and the system will be ready to launch quickly,” he said.\nOn the Component Scheme response\nThe Secretary also highlighted the overwhelming industry response to the Electronics Component Manufacturing (ECM) scheme, with proposals worth ₹1.15 lakh crore—double the government’s initial expectations. However, he cautioned that there was no fixed timeline for approvals.\n“We don’t want to rush the technical teams. The priority is ensuring quality implementation,” Krishnan stressed.\nOn technology transfer under the Component Scheme\nHe underlined that foreign companies applying under joint ventures would be expected to transfer technology to Indian entities.\n“This is embedded in the scheme’s spirit. We’re moving step by step—from assembly to local manufacturing and then to design. India has one of the best STEM talent pools in the world, and that makes it a natural design hub,” he said.(Edited by : Ajay Vaishnav)",

Chandrababu Naidu will launch a new welfare programme titled 'Auto Driverla Sevalo' on October 4. The scheme will provide annual financial assistance of ₹15,000 to 2,90,234 autorickshaw, taxi and maxi cab drivers across the state. The launch will take place in the Vijayawada Central constituency.\n\nThe government has allocated about ₹435 crore for the scheme. The financial aid will be deposited directly into the bank accounts of eligible drivers.\n\nEarlier, under the Vahana Mitra scheme, drivers received ₹12,000 per year. The new programme increases this amount, and both existing Vahana Mitra beneficiaries and new applicants will be included.\n\nAccording to officials, the scheme was announced on September 12 and was initially planned for Dasara but was later rescheduled to October 4. It is intended to help drivers whose incomes have fallen since the government launched the Stree Shakti scheme, which has been providing free bus travel for women since August 15, Independence Day.\n\nEligibility is restricted to permanent residents of Andhra Pradesh who own and drive passenger vehicles such as autorickshaws, taxis or maxi cabs. Applicants must have a valid driving licence, Aadhaar card, ration card and vehicle registration certificate. Drivers operating rented vehicles are not eligible.\n\nThe government has released the beneficiary list on September 24. Drivers can check their eligibility online through the GSWS-NBM portal using their Aadhaar details or offline by visiting Gram Secretariats in rural areas and Ward Secretariats in urban areas.\n\nBesides this initiative, the state government has also reduced green tax on older vehicles and invested in road development to support drivers. Naidu said the programme was not part of the NDA’s original manifesto but has been introduced to address the difficulties caused by Stree Shakti.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the Assembly, the Chief Minister said the NDA coalition, with support from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan, is in a position to expand welfare schemes and increase financial aid compared to the previous government.\n\nHe added that the government is also working on lowering electricity charges, completing irrigation projects worth ₹2,000 crore in North Andhra, finishing six lakh houses by June 2026, and speeding up work on the Bhogapuram international airport, expected to open in August 2026.\n\nIn recent meetings, Naidu highlighted that the state is spending ₹2,745 crore every month on pensions, benefitting 63.5 lakh people, and has disbursed a total of ₹48,019 crore in pensions over the last 16 months. He also said the Stree Shakti scheme has enabled 8.86 crore free bus rides by women in 45 days, with the government spending ₹247 crore per month on it.\n\nNaidu further noted that the state has attracted investments worth ₹10 lakh crore, creating nine lakh jobs, with 4.7 lakh people already employed in the last 15 months. He also promised to continue support for farmers under Annadata Sukheebhava, expand housing programmes, and promote women’s entrepreneurship through DWCRA groups.(Edited by : Vivek Dubey)",

We had aimed to strike their bases. We have no complaints against ordinary Pakistani citizens, so long as their country does not sponsor terrorists.

He said Pakistan also lost radars, command and control centres, runways and hangars.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday, Singh said that the air force has drawn Roadmap 2047 to enhance its combat capabilities, highlighting the need to look for newer aircraft and replace older ones.\nAlso Read: PM Modi to unveil youth-focused initiatives worth over ₹62,000 crore on October 4\n(Edited by : Ajay Vaishnav)",

Symptoms can include high fever and severe joint pain, and about 50% of the patients are said to suffer from long-term joint pain and disability.\n\nWhile there are no specific treatments for the viral mosquito-borne infection, two preventive vaccines have been approved for use in certain countries, including the US.\n\nThe study is the first of its kind to predict chikungunya burden by combining existing data on chikungunya infections with factors that may influence the likelihood of infections, the authors said.\n\nPrevious estimates that often looked at surveillance and outbreak reports could likely be an underestimate, they added.\n\nAlso Read: Rains likely in parts of UP, Bihar; showers predicted in Delhi-NCR\n\nEstimates presented in the study could be useful for prioritising regions and targeting vulnerable age groups — children under 10, adults aged 80 and over — for introducing chikungunya vaccine, the team said.\n\nThey estimated \"global chikungunya burden annually of 14.4 million (1.44 crore) infections\" and \"India and Brazil accounted for 48% of the global burden\".\n\n\"The chronic phase accounts for 54% of chikungunya burden, with relatively higher burden among 40-60-year-old population, with mortality disproportionately affecting children under 10 and adults over 80,” the team added.\n\nLead researcher Hyolim Kang, also a research fellow at Nagasaki University, \"It’s been widely thought that mosquitoes carrying chikungunya would be confined to subtropical or tropical continents, but our analysis has found that the risk extends way beyond these regions.\" \"Prevention of the spread of this disease is important for everyone.\n\nThere are no specific antiviral therapies for chikungunya and treatment relies solely on supportive care. Not only are infections extremely painful, even the healthiest of people can be infected and left with life-long disability,” Kang said.",

Dubbed Exercise Gandiva, this operation involves realistic drills designed to test and enhance the country’s crisis response capabilities.\n\nThe drills are being conducted across various regions and simulate a wide range of terrorist threats. These include complex scenarios involving hostage rescues, bomb threats, armed intrusions, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNe) situations. The goal is to rehearse modern tactics and refine operational responses.\nThe most significant phase of the exercise took place on the nights of October 3 and 4, when the NSG executed simultaneous, high-intensity counter-terror drills in Varanasi, Chittorgarh, Pune, and Jammu. These unprecedented operations, overseen by senior officials from the NSG and the Ministry of Home Affairs, showcased the force's ability to respond swiftly and effectively to coordinated attacks in multiple locations.\n\nKey scenarios during Exercise Gandiva included:\n \tCounter-terror and hostage rescue missions at public places, religious and sensitive locations, and river cruise vessels.\n \tDetection and defusing of bomb and IED threats.\n \tNeutralising armed intrusions at both public and private facilities.\n \tResponse protocols for CBRNe incidents.\n\nExercise Gandiva is part of the NSG’s annual training calendar and is conducted in coordination with State Police Forces, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), Airport and Waterways Authorities, and local administrations. The exercise not only tested rapid deployment capabilities but also highlighted seamless inter-agency coordination and the country's readiness to tackle evolving terrorist threats.\n\nThrough these drills, the NSG demonstrated how even the most challenging operations can be executed successfully with precise planning, coordination, and execution.",

CCPA found that the claim was misleading and concealed crucial information regarding the type and duration of courses opted for by these candidates.The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has imposed a penalty of ₹5 lakhs on Drishti IAS (VDK Eduventures Pvt. Ltd.) for publishing misleading advertisements over the results of the UPSC Civil Services Examination (CSE) 2022.\n\nDrishti IAS, in its advertisement, prominently claimed \"216+ selections in UPSC CSE 2022\" along with names and photographs of successful candidates. However, upon examination, CCPA found that the claim was misleading and concealed crucial information regarding the type and duration of courses opted for by these candidates.\n\nThe investigation revealed that out of the 216 candidates claimed by Drishti IAS, as many as 162 candidates (75%) had only taken the free Interview Guidance Programme (IGP) of the Institute, after independently clearing the Preliminary and Mains stages of UPSC CSE. Only 54 students were enrolled in IGP+ and other courses.\n\nThe authorities stated that Drishti IAS deliberately concealed important information, misleading aspirants and parents into believing the institute was responsible for their success in all stages of the UPSC examination. This act qualifies as a misleading advertisement under Section 2(28) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nCCPA noted that this is the second penalty imposed on Drishti IAS for similar conduct. Earlier, in September 2024, the Authority had passed a final order against the institute for its misleading claim of \"150+ selections in UPSC CSE 2021\". The institute submitted the details of 161 candidates against its claim of 150+ selections in UPSC CSE 2021. Therein, as well, out of the total candidates, 148 were enrolled in IGP, seven were enrolled in the Mains Mentorship Program, four were enrolled in the GS Foundation Program, and one was enrolled in an Optional course. The details of the remaining candidate were not mentioned. CCPA imposed a penalty of ₹ 3 lakh and directed to discontinue the misleading advertisement.\n\nThe order noted that despite being penalised and cautioned earlier, Drishti IAS once again indulged in the same practice for the 2022 examination results by enhancing its claim to \"216+ selections\". It added that the concealment of such crucial information deprived prospective students and parents of their right to make an informed choice under Section 2(9) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, indicating that such advertisements create false expectations and unfairly influence consumer decisions, particularly when large claims are made without transparent disclosure of facts.\n\nSo far, the CCPA has issued 54 notices to various coaching institutes for misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices. Penalties amounting to over ₹ 90.6 lakh have been imposed on 26 coaching institutes, along with directions to discontinue such misleading claims. CCPA noted that all such institutes concealed important information regarding courses opted by successful candidates in their advertisement, which amounts to misleading advertisement under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.\n\nThe Authority has emphasised that all coaching institutes must strictly ensure truthful disclosure of information in their advertisements so that students can make fair and informed decisions regarding their academic choices.",

He said Pakistan's losses included radars, command and control centres, runways and hangars.\n\nThe Air Chief said, \"As far as Pakistan's losses are concerned, we have struck a large number of their airfields and we struck a large number of installations. Because of these strikes, radars at least four places, command and control centres at two places, runways of course damaged at two places, then three of their hangars in three different stations have been damaged.

It has now increased to 83, officials said on Friday, citing the study conducted during the past year.\n\nThe survey also involved strong community participation, indicating that the long-term conservation plans with community involvement are bearing results, they added.\n\nThe new survey released on Thursday (the first day of the Wildlife Week being observed from October 2 to 8) said the count excluded cubs and exceeded the estimated upper confidence limit of 73 over the 2021 survey, reflecting possible expansion of habitats.\nThe survey was conducted through a large-scale camera trapping exercise across six sites over an area of 26,000 sq km. The snow leopards and their habitats were detected in the tribal areas of Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur and the Pangi valley.\n\nHowever, the study also recorded their presence beyond the protected areas, which comprise the Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary, Great Himalayan National Park, Sechu Tuan Nallah Wildlife Sanctuary and Asrang Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nIn addition to snow leopards, the survey also drew distribution maps for key prey species such as the blue sheep, Himalayan ibex and musk deer, as well as other high-altitude mammals such as Himalayan wolves, brown bears, leopards, red foxes, and martens.\n\nNotably, the study reported the first official sighting of Pallas's cat in Kinnaur and the rediscovery of the woolly flying squirrel in Lahaul, highlighting the rich biodiversity of the state.\n\nAccording to the officials, community involvement was key to the survey's success. Local youths and women from Kibber village in Spiti assisted with camera trap deployments and data analysis, while frontline forest officers and other community members supported field operations.

It departed from the newly inaugurated in-plant railway siding at Maruti Suzuki’s Manesar facility and covered more than 850 kilometres to reach the Anantnag railway terminal in Jammu \u0026 Kashmir.\n\nOn the way, the train crossed the Chenab river on the world’s highest railway arch bridge, inaugurated earlier this year under the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link project.\n\nUnion Minister for Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “In recent times, apples from the valley have been transported using the Jammu \u0026 Kashmir rail link. Now, Maruti Suzuki cars will be transported to Kashmir valley by rail. Jammu – Srinagar railway line is a game changer for the people of Jammu \u0026 Kashmir.” Flag off of the first batch of over 100 Maruti Suzuki vehicles sent via rail for Anantnag from Manesar in-plant railway siding.\n\nMaruti Suzuki’s Managing Director \u0026 CEO, Hisashi Takeuchi, said, “Railway dispatches are central to our logistics strategy. The world’s highest railway arch bridge over Chenab river is one such landmark, enabling seamless and efficient connectivity to Kashmir valley and allowing Maruti Suzuki to better serve customers in the region.”\n\nHe added that the company operates in-plant railway sidings at both Manesar and Gujarat under the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, enabling direct dispatches from its production facilities.\n\nThe announcement coincides with a surge in demand during the festive season. Maruti Suzuki delivered 1.65 lakh vehicles in the first eight days of Navratri and expects the figure to cross 2 lakh by the end of the nine-day festival. The company reported 3.5 lakh bookings during this period, with nearly 2.5 lakh still pending.\n\nPartho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer, Marketing \u0026 Sales, said, “It is all because of the initiative taken by our Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on GST rate cut that the industry is witnessing strong growth.”\n\nIn September 2025, Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales fell 8.3 percent year-on-year to 1,35,711 units, down from 1,48,061 in September 2024. However, exports hit a record 42,204 units, a 52.2 percent increase from last year, taking total sales to 1,89,665 units, up 2.7 percent year-on-year. The company has crossed 2.1 lakh units in exports in the first half of the financial year.\n\nSegment-wise, compact cars recorded growth with 66,882 units sold compared to 60,480 in September 2024. Utility vehicles declined to 48,695 units from 61,549 despite demand for Brezza, Ertiga, Fronx, Grand Vitara, and the newly launched Victoris, mainly due to competition.",

    "title": "Eat less meat is still the message from flagship diet report",
    "content": "When a group of leading scientists and nutrition experts unveiled a global diet plan several years ago, few expected it to ignite one of the fiercest food debates in recent memory. Their central prescription seemed innocuous: For an increasingly populous planet to thrive, wealthy nations should eat less meat and more plants.\n\nBut soon after publication, the report from the EAT-Lancet Commission became a lightning rod. The authors were subjected to threats, accused of elitism and targeted in social media campaigns backed by the meat industry. Some policymakers embraced its recommendations, while others, particularly in the US, dismissed it as a “woke” attempt to take away meat from people’s plates.\n\nRound two of that debate has now arrived. Pulling from fresh data and input from experts in more than 30 countries, the commission released a second version of its report on Friday, doubling down on largely the same message: Eat less meat, and more beans, nuts and vegetables — especially if you live in the rich world. The shift could prevent about 15 million premature deaths a year globally and cut farm emissions by 15%.\n\n“By improving diets, we would improve the environment,” said Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University and co-chair of the commission. “There’s an element of urgency here that has only grown since the last time.”\n\nAlso Read: E-commerce, processed foods top sectors for GST-related consumer complaints: Consumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare\n\nFood systems account for about a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, driven largely by animal farming, which is a major source of methane and a drain on land and water resources. Even if the world transitions away from fossil fuels, food alone could push temperatures past the 1.5°C threshold needed to limit warming. The onus falls disproportionately on the wealthy: The richest 30% of the world’s population are responsible for more than 70% of food-related pressures, the report said.\n\nThe commission’s so-called “planetary health diet” resembles the Mediterranean diet and other traditional ones around the world, with recommendations presented as ranges that allow flexibility, according to Willett. It’s not pushing veganism, but simply supporting the idea that animal-sourced foods should be optional, moderate and guided by a “1+1” principle: one dairy serving and one other animal protein source daily. “It allows for cultural diversity and individual preferences,” Willett said.\n\nThe biggest changes will hit the meat and dairy industries. Production of beef, goat and lamb must fall by one-third from 2020 levels through 2050, the report says, and global herds of cattle and other ruminants have to shrink by about a quarter. Still, the report makes clear that diet change alone won’t be enough. Reducing food waste and increasing agricultural productivity are also crucial.\n\nThe updated commission report, dubbed EAT-Lancet 2.0, was prepared by a panel that included experts in livestock, economics, nutrition and climate. It underwent peer review and was funded by organisations including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.\n\nAlso Read: Tata Consumer signs MoU with food ministry for ₹2,000 cr investment over 5 years\n\nThe first version was widely cited after its publication in 2019, appearing in more than 600 policy documents. Cities such as Milan, London and Tokyo pledged to align public food procurement with its recommendations. Policymakers saw it as a “go-to” guide for integrating sustainability into dietary guidelines, said Tim Benton, professor at the University of Leeds and a food security expert.\n\nYet its rollout has been limited. Global meat consumption is still climbing, and alternative protein sales are faltering. The pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and soaring food prices have eroded political and consumer appetite for sustainability. Meanwhile, the political climate has shifted with the rise of right-wing populism. The manosphere and MAGA-influenced machismo have fueled the popularity of the carnivore diet.\n\n“The political power of the livestock sector and then this kind of right-wing populism that ‘no one’s gonna tell me that I can’t eat meat ’— all of those things come together to mean that the EAT-Lancet was quite a juicy target for what we now would call the anti-woke agenda,” Benton said.\n\nFor some of the report’s leading figures, the backlash has been deeply personal.\n\nGunhild Stordalen, the physician who co-founded the EAT Foundation and coordinated funding for the report, was cast online as part of a “Davos elite.” An investigation later found evidence of orchestrated efforts to discredit the study. Critical social media posts, amplified by a network of “misinfluencers” with ties to the livestock industry, used the hashtag #yes2meat, according to the nonprofit Changing Markets Foundation, which warned last week of a fresh campaign against the update.\n\nThe new report attempts to answer some earlier criticism, including claims that its focus was too Western and ignored local diets or affordability. This time, the emphasis is on “just” food systems: Almost half of the world’s population does not have access to affordable, healthy diets, fair wages and safe environments.\n\nThe commission says that while the Global North must cut back sharply, parts of the Global South may need to increase animal protein intake to address malnutrition — though not to the levels seen in wealthy countries.\n\nDelivering those changes, the report argues, will require new policies, from subsidy reforms to taxes, to ensure that healthy food is affordable and accessible. Stordalen said the commission will take the updated report on a global roadshow to highlight its impact in different regions and cultures. It’s also set to host dialogues with anyone from farmers and chefs to consumers and doctors.\n\n“We are bringing all key stakeholders to the table to have conversations, brave conversations, and really trying to change mindsets,” she said.\n\nTrack live stock market updates on CNBC-TV18.com",

Police have been asked to be vigilant at Ramleela grounds, Durga Puja fairs and Ravan Dahan programmes, which draw a massive footfall.\n\n”All district magistrates, deputy collectors, police and administrative officials must discharge their responsibilities seriously. Any lapse will invite stern action,” Chaudhary said.\n\nOfficials said intelligence agencies have also been put on alert and teams deployed in the field.\n\n”Armed police forces are being positioned at sensitive locations. We are ensuring foolproof arrangements so that the disturbances witnessed in Bareilly do not spill over to neighbouring districts,” an official said.\n\nOn September 26, there was a confrontation between police and about 2,000 people who had gathered outside a mosque in the Kotwali area in Bareilly after Friday prayers. Stone-pelting was also reported.\n\nThe unrest was triggered by the cancellation of a protest over the ”I Love Muhammad” poster row called by cleric Tauqeer Khan.\n\nTill Wednesday, 81 people were arrested in connection with the September 26 violence.",

This would provide employment to millions of people and bring light into their lives,” the minister said.\nShah, who is also the Cooperation Minister, said Mahatma Gandhi was the one who recognised the soul of India and awoke the common people of the country to stand up against the British.\n\nHe said Mahatma Gandhi wove many such things into the freedom movement from which the map of future India was framed.\n\nThe home minister said two big ideas emerged from those things — Khadi and ’swadeshi’.\n\n”We cannot separate the freedom movement from Khadi and swadeshi,” he said, adding that by giving these ideas to the country, Mahatma Gandhi not only gave momentum to the freedom movement but also enlightened the lives of many poor people in the country.\n\nShah said that for a very long time, both the ideas of Khadi and ’swadeshi’ were forgotten.\n\nReferring to a major campaign he launched in 2003 in Gujarat for the revival of Khadi, when Modi was the Gujarat chief minister, Shah said Khadi has again become a thing of use for the general public and the direct proof of this is the manifold increase in the use and purchase of Khadi products since 2014.\n\nThe turnover of Khadi Gramodyog has reached ₹1,70,000 crore, which is a great achievement, he said.\n\nShah also appealed to people to strengthen the two campaigns — the use of Khadi and the adoption of ’swadeshi’.\n\n”We should make these a part of our nature and pass on both these campaigns to our next generations,” he said.",

These were heated and mixed, with chemical-based flavouring agents, colours and unsafe additives used to give the mixture the texture and taste of pure desi ghee.\n\nThe product was then packed in tins resembling popular brands and supplied to dairies and shops, particularly during the festive season.\n\n\"Each tin of duplicate ghee costs them around ₹1,300 to ₹1,400 to produce, and they sold it for ₹3,500 to ₹4,000 in the market,\" a senior police officer said.\n\nDuring the raids, police said Safiq was found running a unit in Karawal Nagar with 520 kg of spurious ghee. In another raid, four accused, including Malik and his son, were apprehended from Shiv Vihar with 440 kg of spurious ghee. In Mustafabad, Zamaluddin was arrested with 665 kg of adulterated ghee.\n\nA case has been registered under the relevant provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the Food Safety and Standards Act. Further investigation is underway to trace the wider supply chain and identify others involved, police said.\n\nPolice said some of them were habitual offenders who had been booked earlier for similar crimes.\n\nALSO READ | 9 simple ways to check the purity of ghee at home",

    "title": "Can babies really grow from skin cells? Scientists report a breakthrough",
    "content": "Scientists in Oregon have successfully created human eggs from adult skin cells, marking a major step forward in reproductive science. The breakthrough could one day help infertile women and same-sex couples conceive, though it raises complex ethical and legal questions.adult skin cells. The research, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for new options for women struggling with infertility and even same-sex couples. However, it also raises a host of ethical and legal concerns.\n\n\"It's a significant step forward,\" said Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health \u0026 Science University, who led the team behind the breakthrough.\n\nFor years, scientists have attempted to create human eggs in the lab using the genetic material of people unable to conceive naturally. The field, known as in vitro gametogenesis, has seen labs in the US, Japan and elsewhere racing to find viable solutions. Until now, the most promising results produced only primitive, non-viable egg-like cells.\n\nMitalipov’s team took a different route. Instead of reprogramming cells into stem cells — the path most researchers have pursued — his group used the same cloning technique once employed to create Dolly the sheep. They removed most of the DNA from a donor egg and replaced it with DNA from a woman’s skin cell, then pushed the reconstituted cell through a new process they call “mitomeiosis.”\n\nThe experiment produced 82 functional eggs.\nTo evaluate them, the eggs were fertilized with sperm. Some reached the blastocyst stage — the point at which embryos are typically considered for implantation. None, however, were suitable for transfer. All the embryos showed genetic abnormalities that would prevent normal development.\n\nEven so, experts say the progress is notable. \"I think it's a very significant step in terms of moving forward to the ability to use skin cells to make egg cells for human reproduction at some point in the future, once we can prove this is safe and effective,\" said Dr. Sigal Klipstein of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, speaking to NPR.\n\nIf successful in the long term, the technology could allow infertile women to have children genetically related to them. It could also make it possible for two men to have a biological child together — using skin cells from one partner to create an egg and fertilizing it with sperm from the other. \"The implications are huge,\" Mitalipov said.\n\nAccording to NPR, some scientists are skeptical that the process will ever fully work. Amander Clark, a developmental biologist at UCLA, noted that the technique skips a critical step in normal egg development. \"It is unclear whether skipping meiosis in half the genome is compatible with human development,\" she said.\n\nBeyond the science, ethical debates are already intensifying. Critics worry about scenarios that sound like science fiction but are technically possible — from “designer babies” to the misuse of stolen DNA. \"We could have Taylor Swift babies all over the world,\" said Ronald Green, a Dartmouth College bioethicist. \"It's a theoretical possibility, but not crazy.\"\n\nOthers have raised the idea of a so-called “uni-baby,” a child created using only one person’s DNA. \"Would anyone want to do that? Well, there are 8 billion people in the world… I wouldn’t guarantee that no one would want to do that,\" said Stanford’s Hank Greely, who has written extensively about reproductive ethics, according to NPR.\n\nFor now, the embryos remain far from viable, and years of research lie ahead before the technology could move into human trials. Still, if safety concerns can be addressed, scientists believe it could transform the future of reproduction for millions worldwide.",

    "content": "HomeMarket NewsTrade Setup for October 10: Nifty bulls aim to break above the 25,250 barrier after TCS resultsThe surge in IT stocks has taken the spotlight away from the Nifty Bank, which has remained away from the limelight for a better part of this week. Although the index made a lower high on the charts on Thursday, it made a higher low, and also managed to sustain above the 56,000 mark, which remains level on the downside for the index.While writing the setup for Thursday's trade, we told you about how Tuesday's and Wednesday's sessions were exact replicas on the Nifty 50 charts. Intraday recoveries getting sold into and dips getting bought. Thursday was the reverse of that trend.\n\nSimilar to the last two sessions, the Nifty gave both the bulls and the bears equal opportunity. But unlike the last two sessions, the index ended near the day's high instead of ending at the day's low.\n\nIt may only have been a small margin, but the Nifty did manage to make a higher high and a higher low on the charts in today's session. All sectoral indices ended higher on Thursday, led by Metals, IT and Pharma, with the IT index now gaining 5% so far in the four trading sessions of the week so far.\nIT stocks will continue to remain in focus after TCS results. Two possibilities emerge after the results that surpassed expectations on most fronts - One being that the stock sees some profit booking considering it has gained in three out of the last four trading sessions. Second probability being that considering that the stock is already beaten down and is a major underperformer this year, the recovery from the 52-week lows may just continue.\n\nIn response to TCS' results, the US-listed shares or ADRs of both Infosys and Wipro are trading with gains of up to 1% each.\n\nThe surge in IT stocks has taken the spotlight away from the Nifty Bank, which has remained away from the limelight for a better part of this week. Although the index made a lower high on the charts on Thursday, it made a higher low, and also managed to sustain above the 56,000 mark, which remains level on the downside for the index. On the upside, the 56,280 - 56,300 zone continues to remain a barrier. The Nifty Bank needs to close above 55,589 to also report its fifth weekly gain in the last six weeks.\n\n\"The shorter-term moving averages continue to display strength, with a bullish crossover of the 9-EMA and 20-EMA over the 50-EMA, confirming the continuation of the near-term uptrend. The RSI has inched up to 63, reflecting sustained momentum. A close above 56,300 could open the door for a further move toward 56,550–56,700,\" Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said.\n\n\"The support remains in the 55,900–55,800 zone. The index remains resilient, and as long as 55,800 holds this level, the short-term tone is likely to stay bullish, with a preference to add on declines,\" he added.\n\nThe Nifty has now gained in five out of the last six trading sessions and is set for a weekly advance as well. The index needs to close above the 24,894 mark to register it fifth weekly advance in the last six weeks. The first important level to watch on the upside for the Nifty is Tuesday's swing high of 25,220. The index continues to find support between the 25,000 - 25,050 levels, and that continues to remain the key level on any potential dip.\n\n\"The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. A decisive move above 25,200 levels could pull Nifty towards another resistance of 25,450 levels in the next few sessions. Immediate support is placed at 25000 levels,\" said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.\n\nShrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities believes that the 25,200 - 25,250 zone will continue to be an immediate hurdle for the bulls. A breakout above that zone could take the index back to its recent highs of 25,450 or maybe even 25,500, he added.",

This marks its renewed push into India’s personal care market.\n\nThe new Velvette range will include soaps, shampoos, conditioners, body wash, and talcum powders, and will be rolled out first in Tamil Nadu before expanding to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana by December. A nationwide launch is planned for next year.\n\n“We felt Velvette was a good place to start building a personal care brand. We’ve taken the traditional formulation and built on it. It will be available on top outlets of Tamil Nadu in the next 4 weeks,\" T. Krishnakumar, Director, RCPL told CNBC-TV18..\n\nThe revival of Velvette comes as RCPL accelerates its plans to become a full-scale FMCG player. The company, part of Reliance Retail Ventures, is expanding its portfolio across personal care, homecare, beverages, and packaged foods, and aims to build at least five brands with annual revenues of ₹1,000 crore each by the end of 2027.\n\n“By this time next year, every category will be available nationally,” Krishnakumar said.\n\nRCPL’s existing portfolio includes staples, snacks, biscuits, and homecare products, with new categories such as ready-to-cook, ready-to-eat, and general merchandise in the pipeline. Within general merchandise, the company plans to focus on cleaning aids, a segment with few organised players.\n\nIn beverages, RCPL is introducing Campa Sure, a packaged water brand priced at ₹15 for a one-litre bottle. Positioned under the Campa umbrella for instant brand recognition, Krishnakumar said Campa Sure aims to deliver affordable drinking water while reducing logistics costs through collaborations with local manufacturers. \n\n\n\nThe first bottles will hit the market in North India within three days. Starting with UP, followed by markets like NCR, Jammu Kashmir, etc, a pan-India rollout is expected over the next six months.\n\nKrishnakumar said affordability remains central to RCPL’s strategy. “If you want to build distribution, the mass of India lies in the realm of affordability. Our products are excellent—the same quality or better than those serving premium consumers today,” he said, adding that RCPL’s approach to premiumisation is about “offering more value, not charging a higher price.”\n\nRCPL’s distribution focus remains firmly on general trade, which Krishnakumar described as the company’s “anchor.” He added that RCPL will also expand through institutional channels like railway and canteen stores while building an omnichannel presence.\n\nWith Velvette marking its re-entry into personal care and Campa Sure strengthening its beverage play, RCPL is positioning itself to scale rapidly across India’s mass FMCG market—with an eye on building multiple ₹1,000-crore brands within the next two years.\nNote To ReadersDisclosure: Network18, the parent company of CNBCTV18.com, is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.",

    "content": "India’s largest IT services company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), is making a major pivot towards artificial intelligence (AI) and digital infrastructure, with plans to invest $5–6 billion over the next few years in building data centres and AI capabilities. The company aims to transform itself into the world’s largest AI-led technology services firm, said Samir Seksaria, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of TCS.TCS is reskilling its workforce for the next phase of technology, focusing on high-skill, high-intensity digital roles and has already doubled its AI-skilled workforce to 1.6 lakh.Speaking to ET Now, Seksaria and Sudeep Kunnumal, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), shared insights into the company’s AI transition strategy, investments, and workforce transformation plans.TCS to set up 1-Gigawatt AI data centre capacityAs part of its AI expansion, TCS plans to create one gigawatt (GW) of data centre capacity over the next few years — a significant move into digital infrastructure that will support AI training, cloud computing, and enterprise services.“We will begin with a 150-megawatt phase requiring an investment of around $1 billion, which will become operational in the next 14–18 months,” Seksaria said. “The capacity will gradually scale up to one gigawatt over time.”The total investment, estimated between $5 billion and $6 billion, will be structured through a combination of equity and debt, with potential participation from strategic equity partners.“It will start as a wholly owned subsidiary and, over time, we may bring in a strategic partner to scale the business,” Seksaria confirmed.The planned data centres will focus on AI and sovereign cloud infrastructure, serving both TCS’s enterprise clients and other hyperscalers.Five pillars of TCS’s AI transformationTCS’s transition toward an AI-led model is being guided by what the management calls the company’s “five transformation pillars.” These pillars will shape its investments, workforce strategy, and client engagement over the next few years:Internal transformation:TCS aims to embed AI into every internal function — from operations to decision-making — to enhance efficiency and productivity. Employees are being given access to AI tools and platforms to encourage innovation.Redefining services:The company has created a new AI Business Unit, focusing on talent acquisition, reskilling, and a “human + AI” service delivery model.Becoming future ready:TCS is reskilling its workforce for the next phase of technology, focusing on high-skill, high-intensity digital roles to stay ahead of global tech trends.AI for clients:TCS is working closely with clients through “AI Innovation Days” and short-cycle delivery models — 8-to-12-week AI projects that demonstrate tangible business outcomes before scaling.Ecosystem play and partnerships:Beyond its in-house efforts, TCS is deepening partnerships with niche AI players, hyperscalers, and enterprise tech companies. The company has already announced an acquisition in the Salesforce domain and is exploring further inorganic growth opportunities.Transforming into an AI-first technology companyTCS’s move to become an AI-first technology company is not an overnight shift, Seksaria emphasized.“This is a journey. We’ve been investing in AI, cloud, and data for years, but now we are accelerating to the next level,” he said. “There are short-term steps such as restructuring and talent readiness, and longer-term initiatives like ecosystem expansion.”He added that every client project will increasingly have AI integrated — whether for improving productivity, speeding up delivery, or enhancing end-user experience.AI workforce doubles to 1.6 lakh employeesThe company’s HR transformation is just as significant as its infrastructure and business model changes.According to CHRO Sudeep Kunnumal, TCS’s AI and machine learning (ML) talent base has more than doubled over the past year.“Our deep-tech talent pool in AI and ML was around 70,000 last year; today it stands at 160,000 employees,” Kunnumal said. “We’ve democratized access to AI infrastructure across offices so employees can experiment, learn, and build solutions.”TCS has been conducting large-scale AI learning initiatives, including hackathons and internal innovation challenges. “Every employee now has access to AI learning platforms. Learning hours have doubled over the past year,” Kunnumal added.18,500 new hires in Q2, Focus on future-ready skillsDespite restructuring in parts of its workforce, TCS continues to hire aggressively in future-facing areas.“We hired 18,500 people globally this quarter — that’s our gross hiring — across markets, focusing on future-ready digital and AI skills,” Kunnumal confirmed.The company has also reaffirmed its commitment to onboarding all campus recruits with prior offers.On reports about layoffs, Kunnumal clarified:“We are restructuring certain areas but have honoured all offers and are on track to onboard them. The narrative around layoffs is exaggerated.”Long-term vision: AI-enabled growth and new revenue mixTCS expects its AI-led transformation to not only redefine its internal processes but also reshape its revenue mix over time. The company envisions a model where AI-enabled projects form a significant share of future growth.“Every project we undertake will increasingly have an AI component — whether for automation, analytics, or transformation,” Seksaria said.The company’s aim is clear: to emerge as a global leader in AI-led digital services, blending deep technology expertise with a scalable infrastructure base.",

    "content": "India's largest bank is set to return to the rupee debt market after a year with plans to raise funds through Basel III-compliant tier II bonds this month, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. State Bank of India is in advanced stages of issuing the bonds with a 10-year duration to raise as much as 75 billion rupees (about $845.7 million), the sources said. The lender may invite bids before the end of the month, they added. SBI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media. The bonds will have a call option at the end of five years, and at the end of every year thereafter, the sources said.  \"The issue would be priced as per a five-year instrument, and currently, there is sufficient gap between five-year and 10-year bond yields, which must have pushed them towards the shorter tenor,\" one of the sources said. Merchant bankers said that mutual funds could bid aggressively for the issue. SBI had planned the tier II bond issue by August but delayed it due to the rise in yields. The bank also shelved an infrastructure bond issue in March due to elevated yields. ($1 = 88.6870 Indian rupees)",

    "title": "TCS bets big on AI and data centres; every project will be AI-led, says CEO K Krithivasan",
    "content": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is doubling down on its artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation strategy while expanding into adjacencies such as data centres and sovereign cloud infrastructure. The company’s leadership says this multi-pronged approach will position TCS as the world’s largest AI-led technology services provider in the coming years.In an interaction with ET Now, K Krithivasan, CEO \u0026 Managing Director, and Aarthi Subramanian, Executive Director, President \u0026 COO, outlined how the company’s internal transformation, client engagement model, and growth strategy are being reshaped around AI and emerging digital ecosystems.AI at the core of TCS’s transformationTCS, India’s largest IT services exporter, has embarked on an ambitious plan to make every layer of its business “AI-led.”Krithivasan said the company’s vision rests on five key pillars — internal transformation, AI-infused services, workforce upskilling, evolving business models, and expansion into adjacencies like data centres and sovereign cloud.“We are investing heavily in building platforms, training our people, and creating infrastructure to lead in AI,” he said. “If we have to reach our rightful place, we need to transform internally, embed AI into every client service, and expand into areas that strengthen our presence in the global AI ecosystem.”The company has already trained over 1.6 lakh employees in AI tools and processes. “Our workforce transformation is key to ensuring that every TCS employee becomes an AI practitioner,” he added.AI-first culture: World’s largest hackathonCEO Aarthi Subramanian highlighted TCS’s push to create an AI-first culture across its global operations. Over the past quarter, the company provided AI access to more than 600,000 employees and organised the world’s largest AI hackathon, where 280,000 employees participated over an eight-week period to build AI-led solutions.“All of us, including the leadership team, got hands-on with AI,” Subramanian said. “The hackathon was part of driving an AI-first mindset — we want every employee to experiment, innovate, and co-create with AI.”She added that TCS is redefining every service line with a “human-plus-AI” operating model, combining human creativity and judgment with machine intelligence for faster, more scalable outcomes.Every project now has an AI componentTCS’s leadership said nearly every client engagement today incorporates AI in some form — whether for improving productivity, accelerating delivery, or enhancing customer value.“It’s becoming difficult to find a project that doesn’t have an AI element,” Krithivasan said. “Our ambition is that every TCS project will be AI-led, either through automation, analytics, or AI-enabled delivery.”Subramanian added that embedding AI into all operations is no longer optional.“To be competitive in today’s environment, you must make AI part of every interaction and every workflow,” she said.Strong deal wins and outcome-based projectsTCS reported $10 billion in total contract value (TCV) for the quarter, with a healthy mix of large, multi-year projects and shorter, outcome-driven engagements.“We now have rapid build projects that last 8–16 weeks, alongside traditional multi-year contracts — but every engagement now has AI built into it,” said Krithivasan.He cited the company’s recent Tryg Insurance deal as an example of how AI is being integrated end-to-end — from IT operations to application development and transformation.TCS is also conducting “AI Innovation Days” with clients, where teams co-create and test use cases in real time to convert hype into measurable business value.Demand environment improving graduallyWhile macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, TCS sees early signs of recovery in global tech spending.“Discretionary demand is slowly improving,” Krithivasan said. “Earlier we spoke about project deferments and cancellations — those have reduced. As trade deals get signed and confidence returns, we expect spending to pick up.”For the quarter, TCS reported constant currency revenue growth of 0.8%, improved operating margins by 70 basis points, and added over 18,000 employees. Despite wage hikes and severance costs, the company maintained profitability, supported by cost discipline and efficiency measures.Sectoral outlook: BFSI leads, UK weakensThe BFSI segment continues to perform well globally, especially in North America, which remains TCS’s largest market. However, UK revenues declined due to a pricing adjustment in one of its long-term insurance contracts.“The UK drop was linked to a scheduled price reduction under a per-policy model — a one-off adjustment,” Krithivasan clarified.Expanding into data centres and sovereign cloudOne of TCS’s biggest strategic moves this year is its expansion into data centre operations — a segment with massive potential in India.Krithivasan said the company’s decision is driven by both business opportunity and the need to deepen its participation in the AI value chain.“India currently has around 1.2 gigawatts of data centre capacity, but demand is expected to grow to 10 gigawatts in the next five years,” he said. “We plan to add one gigawatt of data centre capacity over the next five to seven years.”The company is also developing a sovereign, secure cloud offering to cater to Indian enterprises and government entities. These initiatives, he said, will strengthen TCS’s ecosystem partnerships with hyperscalers and AI players while opening new revenue streams.AI everywhere: The road aheadWith a strong order book, improving demand outlook, and a rapidly advancing AI transformation, TCS is positioning itself for sustainable growth.“Our goal is clear — every project we do will be AI-led,” Krithivasan reiterated. “We are embedding AI into everything we do — from internal processes to customer solutions — to redefine what it means to be a technology services company.”Subramanian echoed this sentiment, saying AI would not just be a technology shift but a cultural transformation at TCS.“We are building an organisation where humans and AI collaborate to deliver outcomes faster, smarter, and better,” she said.Key highlightsTCS aims to become the world’s largest AI-led services company.$10 billion TCV in Q2; most deals have AI components.600,000+ employees given AI access; 280,000 joined AI hackathon.Plans to build 1 GW data centre capacity in India.BFSI and North America drive growth; UK slowdown temporary.Margins expand 70 bps despite wage hikes.",

    "title": "TCS results, AI bets and metals rally: Parag Thakkar sees value across IT, metals and banking sector",
    "content": "In an exclusive conversation with ET Now, Parag Thakkar, from Fort Capital shared his perspective on Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS) latest quarterly results, the company’s strategic shift towards AI and data centre investments, and his bullish stance on the metals and banking sectors. “We have 2.5% weight in TCS and we are not going to sell at this price,” Thakkar began, making his position clear. “Whether we will add more depends... See, the two-three things which are positive is first of all the result was positive. 0.8% CC growth, 25.2% margin in spite of one month of wage hike impact; deal wins were very good, $10 billion; plus a commentary that project cancellations and deferrals have stopped; H2 is looking better.” According to Thakkar, the current valuation leaves little reason to exit. “Considering the fact that stock is now trading at only 20 times FY27 earnings expected EPS of Rs 150, I would not sell the stock for sure.” When asked about TCS’s investment push towards data centres and AI, Thakkar dismissed concerns over free cash flow diversion. “See, data centre, I will say that one gigawatt which is $6 to $7 billion over next five to seven years and that too with a partner who will be investing equity also and they will be partly funded through debt also. So, I would say, it is not a big strain on a balance sheet which has 50,000 crore cash already, plus it generates 50,000 crore of profits every year which is free cash flow.” He added that market perceptions of capital allocation often miss the broader context. “When Infosys did buyback, people said that Indian companies are still rewarding shareholders by doing buybacks, while others are investing. Now when TCS is investing, you cannot have both views right. Either of the two can be right.” For Thakkar, TCS’s move represents a long-term strategic evolution. “If TCS is able to showcase good execution there, if they are able to tell to market that who are the main clients, whether the entire data centre plan is completely being booked or leased out, those things are very important; plus it will improve the relationship with their customers like AWS or Salesforce because now they are investing in physical infrastructure also for them, not only providing services. So, I do not think that any of their decisions are wrong and so I am not a seller for sure.” Turning to the metals space, Thakkar expressed continued optimism. “Metal stocks generally move in tandem with the metal prices. So, we have seen that Hindalco has moved from say 650 to 770 and aluminium prices on LME has also moved from say $2,500 to now closer to $2,740, $2,760,” he noted. “One of the reason is the weakness in dollar because you are going to expect rate cuts in US, so basically one of the good reason is dollar index falling and the other reason is, of course, China putting cap on its capacities.” He highlighted that government protection and domestic fundamentals make Indian metal companies attractive. “In aluminium they do not produce above 45 million tonnes and, of course, in steel safeguard duty and all has protected Indian steel company. So, I am constructive on the sector, overweight on the sector and with large position in Hindalco and some position in Tata Steel and I would like to hold on.” Thakkar sees long-term triggers in play. “In Hindalco I see multiple long-term triggers, like they have got the coal mines in place now which will increase their aluminium ebitda per tonne over next two years, then Novelis new plant will start next year where the average realization will improve significantly, that is what they have guided, $600 per tonne ebitda. So, I would like to hold on to Hindalco and Tata Steels of the world in metal space.” On the banking front, Thakkar expects strong earnings momentum ahead. “What I feel is this is a phase of the margin, maximum margin contraction which I expect on core basis is 5 to 9 bps in both cases. From here on due to GST cut-led surge in demand, the credit growth is only going to increase. Margins will also gradually inch up because of deposit repricing and CRR cut and I am seeing a very fantastic next year for banks like HDFC and ICICI and SBI also which have a pristine asset quality track record.” He also underscored the prudence of large banks in provisioning. “ECL provisioning and that has been a point of discussion after RBI policy, there also a prudent bank like HDFC Bank has done a huge contingency provision when they came out with IPO of HDB Financial Services and raised 9,000 crores, instead of booking it in P\u0026L, they did a contingency buffer which will come to help if they have to do any provisioning on ECL front, so that will also protect them.” Valuations, he said, remain comfortable. “At two times price to book, 15 PE is no longer expensive. So, I would say that we have a very large weight in HDFC, ICICI, and SBI in our portfolio and we would continue to hold on.” From IT to metals and banking, Thakkar’s stance remains clear — fundamentals and long-term value are still intact across sectors, even as markets digest short-term shifts in strategy and sentiment.",

    "title": "TCS taking a balanced, low risk Path on AI Investments: Sandip Agarwal",
    "content": "India’s largest software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has announced a $7 billion investment in data centres and AI-linked infrastructure — a move that marks one of its most ambitious strategic shifts in recent years. The announcement comes alongside a 3% fall in employee headcount, which the company attributes to efficiency gains from automation and AI integration.Speaking to ET Now, Sandip Agarwal, from Sowilo Investment Managers, said he was not concerned about the decline in staff numbers.“I am not at all surprised with the fall in employee count because in my opinion there must be rationalization of employee across IT services companies,” he said.“AI itself means that your efforts will go down by 30-40%, so you cannot keep adding people when your efforts are going down, so that is actually a positive and not a negative for any company in the sector.”He added that rationalising the workforce is essential for maintaining profitability and competitiveness in an AI-driven era.“Everyone must rationalize their workforce to maintain their profitability and growth,” Agarwal noted.Muted Growth Expectations for FY26–27Agarwal cautioned investors against expecting a sharp rebound in the next fiscal year.“FY26 you will not see any big numbers, even in FY27 I think from IT services expecting largecap to be more than 6-7% growth is too much,” he said.“The largecap IT companies would not see more than mid-single to high-single digit growth and for that growth the multiples are quite decent or maybe, I would say, relatively higher.”He also highlighted that new revenue streams from emerging technologies will take time to contribute meaningfully to topline growth.Data Centres Seen as a Strategic ExtensionOn TCS’s $7 billion data centre investment, Agarwal struck an optimistic tone, calling it a “very good and positive” step.“These companies have much higher advantage than anyone else who is coming into the data centre business,” he said. “They have the technical knowhow, a strong balance sheet, and a cash cow in their services business.”However, he warned that such projects have long gestation periods.“Numbers will take time to come because you know data centres take 18 to 24 months when they start contributing to revenue,” Agarwal explained. “Margins may be a little lower but at least it is much better than doing the buybacks which they were doing.”He further noted that small acquisitions could help TCS strengthen its AI and infrastructure capabilities.“Rather than doing buyback, extending into related areas is a much better thing and obviously when you start that then you can do small-small acquisitions which can keep on adding on your capabilities.”TCS Takes the Middle Path on ReturnsCommenting on the potential impact of the investment on return ratios, Agarwal said TCS had opted for a balanced approach.“There was one path where you go aggressive in R\u0026D and start building AI capabilities which would have burned $20, $30, $40 billion… and the other path was distributing that money for buyback or dividend,” he said.“In the middle there was a path where you are not going to burn money like that and that was this business which they have announced where you are certain of making returns.”He believes this strategy ensures better use of capital.“Returns could be less or more, but at least it will be much higher than what they would be doing by keeping the money in banks and getting 6-7% return which is also taxable.”Sector-Wide ImplicationsAccording to Agarwal, TCS’s move could inspire similar capital allocation strategies across India’s top IT players.“The natural read through for everyone will be that whoever has a huge cash balance — whether it is Infosys, HCL, or Wipro — they will all take this path,” he said. “We have huge demand which will come for data centre in next 5, 7, 10 years and these companies honestly I believe are much better placed than the other data centre, local players who are coming.”He described TCS’s decision as a “low-risk, right step” compared with other capital deployment options.“This is a good step and this is the right thing to do and this step has much lower risk than any other step they would have taken.”‘Good Use of Cash’ Even Without High GrowthWhile he does not issue formal price targets, Agarwal maintained that such strategic capital deployment improves the quality of growth in large-cap IT firms.“We believe that largecap IT sector on their own IT services there will not be more than 5-7% growth, but this kind of action which they have taken to utilise cash is really good in my opinion,” he concluded.",

    "title": "TCS bets $6 billion on AI data centers: Bold pivot or costly detour?",
    "content": "India's IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services has kicked off one of its most ambitious bets yet — a $6 billion foray into artificial intelligence infrastructure that marks a decisive pivot from its traditional services-led model toward the capital-heavy world of AI data centres. Just when India's IT services giants were being blamed widely for having been left out in the AI boom, TCS declared ambitions to become the world's largest AI-led technology services company.The company plans to build a sovereign, co-location AI data centre of up to 1 GW capacity in India over the next five to seven years through a new subsidiary. But with returns uncertain and synergies with its core services unclear, the $6 billion question is whether this bold leap will redefine TCS's growth story or test its financial discipline.Analysts remain split. Some call it a strategic move to future-proof the business as global AI demand explodes; others warn it's a low-margin, high-capex detour that could dilute TCS's stellar return profile.The initiative signals a rare shift in strategy for the usually conservative IT giant, putting its balance sheet to work at a time when the industry is chasing AI scale. TCS will follow a co-location model, where it will provide the passive infrastructure and clients will bring in compute and storage. The company expects the capital intensity to be approximately $1 billion per 150 MW, with funding to be structured through a mix of equity and debt, supported by financial partners, TCS said in an analyst call after declaring its Q2 numbers on Thursday.Management said the first phase will become operational in 18–24 months, with initial anchor clients from hyperscalers, deep-tech AI firms, Indian enterprises, and sovereign projects. TCS noted that India's current installed data-centre capacity stands at approximately 1.2 GW, but demand could expand nearly 10x in the next five to six years, while committed capacity is only 5–6 GW, creating a significant revenue opportunity.Also Read | Is the AI boom becoming a bubble? Why Goldman, JPMorgan, IMF are sounding the alarmDalal Street isn't entirely convinced. Akshat Agarwal of Jefferies said the move was surprising for three reasons. First, it doesn't materially change TCS's growth profile since at full potential in FY31, revenues from the business will be approximately $1.2 billion and add only 0.6% revenue CAGR over FY25-31. Second, it's a physical infrastructure leasing business with little relationship to TCS's existing IT service business. Third, it's a capex-heavy, low ROCE (8–12%) business, quite the opposite of TCS's current business.Jefferies maintained its Hold rating with a price target of Rs 3,100 based on 21x PE, cutting FY26–28 EPS estimates by up to 1% and expecting only a 4% EPS CAGR over FY26–28E. The firm noted it has not modeled the impact of the data centre foray in its numbers, though the likely impact on free cash flow and payouts may be less than 10% due to the use of debt funding.Motilal Oswal highlighted that TCS will not run cloud workloads or provide managed cloud services — the data centre will function as a sovereign co-location site. \"This means low technology intensity, limited overlap with TCS's core services portfolio, and hence minimal direct synergies,\" the brokerage noted.The firm added that ROE at the subsidiary level will be lower than TCS's over 50% group ROE, given the capital-intensive nature. However, management guided that at the consolidated level, it will not be margin-dilutive, as external partners will share funding. Motilal Oswal said the move is \"best viewed as cash deployment rather than a services-led growth driver.\"Also Read | TCS Q2 Results: Cons PAT rises 1.4% YoY to Rs 12,075 crore, misses street estimatesNomura questioned the return profile, noting it is \"unclear to us how the ROEs of this business will be similar to existing business RoE of ~50% given its capex-heavy nature with IRRs at ~20%.\"However, not everyone is bearish. Nuvama called the decision \"a balanced one, as it explores growth opportunities in the tech ecosystem, with manageable capital commitment (for TCS's balance sheet size) and decent returns profile (though lower than its own).\" The brokerage acknowledged TCS is \"deploying significant capital, in high-growth but lower RoCE business, than its own,\" but views it as an acceptable trade-off.JM Financial struck the most bullish tone, calling the co-location foray \"value accretive,\" though it sees \"limited synergies with its Services business at this stage.\" Importantly, the brokerage said, \"TCS' willingness to put its balance sheet to use, a significant deviation from its earlier conservative approach, is a welcome change in the current dynamic environment. Investors should encourage this.\" JM Financial maintained its Buy rating.The Five Pillars of AI StrategyBeyond the data centre, management laid out five pillars of its AI strategy: making TCS AI-first by enabling employees to learn, experiment, and embed AI in daily work; redefining every service line under a \"human + AI\" delivery blueprint; building a future-ready talent model by investing in future-ready skills and recruiting top talent locally; making AI real for clients through rapid builds, AI labs and offices, and value-chain solutions across industries; and strengthening ecosystem partnerships while stepping up efforts in M\u0026A and scaling AI platforms — including the recent acquisition of ListEngage.The company is targeting an annuity stream of revenue from pure-play AI players, deep-tech, hyperscalers, and private and government enterprises in India.While TCS posted a decent quarter on low expectations, its decision to invest in an AI data centre takes it to an interesting crossroad — one where its legendary financial discipline meets the capital-hungry demands of the AI era. Whether this gamble pays off may define the company's next chapter.",

(TCS) have been upgraded by brokerage firm Avendus Spark after its September quarter results on Friday, October 10. The stock will react to the results that were reported after market hours on Thursday.\n\nAvendus Spark upgraded shares of TCS to \"buy\" from its earlier rating of \"add\", with a price target of ₹3,700 per share, compared to ₹3,690 earlier. The revised price target implies a potential upside of 20% from current levels.\n\nThe brokerage wrote in its note that the deal win momentum for TCS remains strong and provides visibility on revenue recovery through the second half of the current financial year.\nDespite continued pressure on discretionary spends, the management tone on growth outlook is optimistic aided by vector consolidation deals, Avendus said.\n\nOn the AI data center announcements, the brokerage said that it carries significant potential, as well as risks. As a result, it has largely maintained its revenue and EBIT margin estimates for TCS for financial year 2026 and 2027.\n\nMost of the other analysts covering TCS have either maintained their views or expressed caution with regards to the announcements made by the management.Citi\nCiti has maintained its \"sell\" rating on the stock with a price target of ₹2,800.\n\nThe brokerage said that its Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates are largely unchanged.

The brokerage said that the quarter was a beat on all fronts with broad-based growth and UK and retail being the remaining pain points.\n\n\"More importantly, TCS is showing clear signs of aggression with proactive decisions around restructuring its workforce to make it AI ready, being more acquisitive in future around technologies in demand and plans to create 1GW of data centre capacity over the next 5-7 years,\" CLSA said.\n\nThe brokerage added that the capex push will offer more vertically integrated technology solutions and drive earnings growth, but will alter its Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) and Free Cash Flow / Net Profit profile.Nomura\nNomura has maintained its \"neutral\" rating on the stock with a price target of ₹3,300.\n\nIt said that the foray into data centers will increase its presence in the AI ecosystem, however, a significant margin improvement is unlikely.\n\nThe brokerage also added that it remains unclear as to how the Return on Equity (RoE) of the data center business will be similar to the existing business RoE of over 50%, as it is capex-heavy in nature.Jefferies\nJefferies has maintained its \"hold\" rating on TCS with a price target of ₹3,100.\n\nIt said that growth in key markets is yet to recover, and that a 3% sequential decline in headcount does not bode well for the company.\n\nTCS' data center foray has limited synergies with IT Services, according to Jefferies, and as a result, it has cut its estimates by up to 1% and expects TCS' Earnings Per Share (EPS) to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4% over financial year 2026-2028.\n\nOut of the 51 analysts that have coverage on TCS, 33 have a \"buy\" rating, 13 say \"hold\", while five have a \"sell\" recommendation.\n\nShares of TCS have gained in three out of the four trading sessions this week, continuing their rebound from the 52-week low that the stock fell to on October 1.

The stock, which opened at ₹3,050 against the previous close of ₹3,061.70, has recorded a traded volume of 63.45 lakh shares worth ₹1,925.53 crore. JM Financial maintains a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of ₹3,520, highlighting TCS’s operational performance that has exceeded expectations. The firm noted sequential revenue growth of 0.8 per cent in constant currency terms and a 70 basis points expansion in operating margins to 25.2 per cent. Deal wins improved 16 per cent year-on-year to $10 billion, with a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x. The brokerage upgraded its FY26-28 earnings estimates by 2 per cent, citing improved cost management through a 3 per cent sequential headcount reduction. Axis Securities has assigned a ‘Buy’ recommendation with a target of ₹3,460, valuing the stock at 22x FY27 estimated earnings. The firm emphasised TCS’s strategic pivot towards becoming an AI-led technology services company, backed by its decision to build a 1GW AI data-center capacity in India, with an investment of approximately $7 billion over five to seven years. For the quarter ended September 30, TCS reported revenue of ₹65,799 crore, up 3.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter, beating the poll estimate of ₹65,114 crore. However, net profit of ₹12,121 crore fell short of the ₹12,528 crore consensus estimate. The company declared a dividend of ₹11 per share with a record date of October 15. TCS also announced the acquisition of US-based ListEngage for up to $72.80 million to strengthen its Salesforce capabilities and Agentic AI offerings. Additionally, the company unveiled plans to create 5,000 new jobs in the UK over the next three years, while launching an AI Experience Zone in London. Both brokerages remain optimistic about TCS’s growth prospects, citing strong deal pipelines, improved international market outlook, and strategic investments in AI infrastructure despite near-term demand challenges.

Since this is high operating leverage business (higher offshore employee base versus peers), margins may drop in FY26E on weak revenues before recovering in FY27E/28E. We factor in 5.1% earnings CAGR in FY25-28E. The multiple has already moderated from the peak of 80x to 48.8X one-year forward. Given muted revenue and earnings growth outlook, this multiple is likely to be challenged, in our view. We maintain Sell with TP unchanged at INR 4,390, based on 30x FY28E P/E.

    "title": "TCS bets $6 billion on AI data centers: Bold pivot or costly detour?",
    "content": "India's IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services has kicked off one of its most ambitious bets yet — a $6 billion foray into artificial intelligence infrastructure that marks a decisive pivot from its traditional services-led model toward the capital-heavy world of AI data centres. Just when India's IT services giants were being blamed widely for having been left out in the AI boom, TCS declared ambitions to become the world's largest AI-led technology services company.The company plans to build a sovereign, co-location AI data centre of up to 1 GW capacity in India over the next five to seven years through a new subsidiary. But with returns uncertain and synergies with its core services unclear, the $6 billion question is whether this bold leap will redefine TCS's growth story or test its financial discipline.Analysts remain split. Some call it a strategic move to future-proof the business as global AI demand explodes; others warn it's a low-margin, high-capex detour that could dilute TCS's stellar return profile.The initiative signals a rare shift in strategy for the usually conservative IT giant, putting its balance sheet to work at a time when the industry is chasing AI scale. TCS will follow a co-location model, where it will provide the passive infrastructure and clients will bring in compute and storage. The company expects the capital intensity to be approximately $1 billion per 150 MW, with funding to be structured through a mix of equity and debt, supported by financial partners, TCS said in an analyst call after declaring its Q2 numbers on Thursday.Management said the first phase will become operational in 18–24 months, with initial anchor clients from hyperscalers, deep-tech AI firms, Indian enterprises, and sovereign projects. TCS noted that India's current installed data-centre capacity stands at approximately 1.2 GW, but demand could expand nearly 10x in the next five to six years, while committed capacity is only 5–6 GW, creating a significant revenue opportunity.Also Read | Is the AI boom becoming a bubble? Why Goldman, JPMorgan, IMF are sounding the alarmDalal Street isn't entirely convinced. Akshat Agarwal of Jefferies said the move was surprising for three reasons. First, it doesn't materially change TCS's growth profile since at full potential in FY31, revenues from the business will be approximately $1.2 billion and add only 0.6% revenue CAGR over FY25-31. Second, it's a physical infrastructure leasing business with little relationship to TCS's existing IT service business. Third, it's a capex-heavy, low ROCE (8–12%) business, quite the opposite of TCS's current business.Jefferies maintained its Hold rating with a price target of Rs 3,100 based on 21x PE, cutting FY26–28 EPS estimates by up to 1% and expecting only a 4% EPS CAGR over FY26–28E. The firm noted it has not modeled the impact of the data centre foray in its numbers, though the likely impact on free cash flow and payouts may be less than 10% due to the use of debt funding.Motilal Oswal highlighted that TCS will not run cloud workloads or provide managed cloud services — the data centre will function as a sovereign co-location site. \"This means low technology intensity, limited overlap with TCS's core services portfolio, and hence minimal direct synergies,\" the brokerage noted.The firm added that ROE at the subsidiary level will be lower than TCS's over 50% group ROE, given the capital-intensive nature. However, management guided that at the consolidated level, it will not be margin-dilutive, as external partners will share funding. Motilal Oswal said the move is \"best viewed as cash deployment rather than a services-led growth driver.\"Also Read | TCS Q2 Results: Cons PAT rises 1.4% YoY to Rs 12,075 crore, misses street estimatesNomura questioned the return profile, noting it is \"unclear to us how the ROEs of this business will be similar to existing business RoE of ~50% given its capex-heavy nature with IRRs at ~20%.\"However, not everyone is bearish. Nuvama called the decision \"a balanced one, as it explores growth opportunities in the tech ecosystem, with manageable capital commitment (for TCS's balance sheet size) and decent returns profile (though lower than its own).\" The brokerage acknowledged TCS is \"deploying significant capital, in high-growth but lower RoCE business, than its own,\" but views it as an acceptable trade-off.JM Financial struck the most bullish tone, calling the co-location foray \"value accretive,\" though it sees \"limited synergies with its Services business at this stage.\" Importantly, the brokerage said, \"TCS' willingness to put its balance sheet to use, a significant deviation from its earlier conservative approach, is a welcome change in the current dynamic environment. Investors should encourage this.\" JM Financial maintained its Buy rating.The Five Pillars of AI StrategyBeyond the data centre, management laid out five pillars of its AI strategy: making TCS AI-first by enabling employees to learn, experiment, and embed AI in daily work; redefining every service line under a \"human + AI\" delivery blueprint; building a future-ready talent model by investing in future-ready skills and recruiting top talent locally; making AI real for clients through rapid builds, AI labs and offices, and value-chain solutions across industries; and strengthening ecosystem partnerships while stepping up efforts in M\u0026A and scaling AI platforms — including the recent acquisition of ListEngage.The company is targeting an annuity stream of revenue from pure-play AI players, deep-tech, hyperscalers, and private and government enterprises in India.While TCS posted a decent quarter on low expectations, its decision to invest in an AI data centre takes it to an interesting crossroad — one where its legendary financial discipline meets the capital-hungry demands of the AI era. Whether this gamble pays off may define the company's next chapter.",

    "title": "Reliance Power shares soar 15%. Here’s what is fuelling the rally",
    "content": "Shares of Reliance Power gained as much as 15% to their day’s high of Rs 50.75 on the NSE on Friday, October 10, amid renewed buying interest and strong volumes. Data showed that around 7 crore equity shares of the company changed hands, compared to its one-week and one-month average trading volumes of 2 crore shares each.Last week, the company received Show Cause Notices from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) related to matters concerning CLE Private Limited. The issue stems from past exposures and disclosures regarding CLE. The company denied any ongoing financial ties, though regulatory scrutiny has drawn market attention, especially as the notices came months after settlements and clarifications were already recorded.Q1 Performance SnapshotAnil Ambani-led Reliance Power reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 44.68 crore for Q1 FY26, a turnaround from a loss of Rs 97.85 crore in the same quarter last year.Revenue from operations fell 5.3% year-on-year to Rs 1,885.58 crore, down from Rs 1,992.23 crore in Q1 FY25, and declined 4.7% sequentially from Rs 1,978.01 crore in Q4 FY25. Total income in Q1 FY26 stood at Rs 2,025 crore, reflecting a 2% decline from Rs 2,069 crore a year earlier.Despite the year-on-year profit recovery, net profit fell 64% quarter-on-quarter, compared with Rs 125.57 crore in the March quarter.Also read: Is the AI boom becoming a bubble?

    "title": "Buy, Sell or Hold: JM Financial recommends buy on TCS post Q2 results; Motilal Oswal recommends Sell on Ta",
    "content": "Brokerages have released their latest views on key companies across sectors, offering a mix of bullish and cautious tones. JM Financial remains optimistic on TCS, citing strong international growth prospects, margin improvement, and strategic investments in AI and digital infrastructure. Morgan Stanley continues to back Muthoot Finance with an Overweight rating, projecting robust loan growth and improved efficiency metrics. On the other hand, Motilal Oswal has turned cautious on Tata Elxsi, maintaining a Sell call as muted tech spending and margin pressures weigh on near-term performance. Here’s a detailed look at what each brokerage had to say for the next 12 months. We have collated a list of recommendations from top brokerage firms from ETNow and other sources:JM Financial on TCS: Buy | Target Rs 3,520 (vs Rs 3,410) | LTP Rs 3,061 | Upside 15% JM Financial has maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on TCS with a revised target price of Rs 3,520 (earlier 3,410), implying a 15% upside from the current market price of Rs 3,061. The brokerage expects international growth in FY26 to outpace FY25’s modest 0.7% constant currency growth, supported by a leaner base that allows for either margin expansion or reinvestment toward growth initiatives. TCS’s announcement of a 1GW AI Data Centre in India over the next 5–7 years with a USD 7 billion investment underscores its ambition to scale up in high-potential digital infrastructure areas. The company is also focusing on acquisitions across AI, Cloud, and Cybersecurity, reflecting a proactive approach towards future technologies. JM Financial notes that TCS’s bold capital deployment marks a strategic shift from its traditional conservatism. Additionally, a 3% reduction in headcount, with another 1% expected, indicates a durable reset of the cost base. Margins are estimated to rise by 43–74 basis points, leading to 2% EPS upgrades for FY26–28E. The brokerage also highlighted that there is no contribution yet from the data centre business, and the stock currently trades at 21x earnings, leaving room for potential re-rating as new initiatives begin to bear fruit.Morgan Stanley on Muthoot Finance: Overweight | Target Rs 3,660 (vs Rs 3,340) | LTP Rs 3,251 | Upside 12% Morgan Stanley has maintained an ‘Overweight’ rating on Muthoot Finance with a revised target price of Rs 3,660 (earlier 3,340), implying a 12% upside from the current market price of Rs 3,251. The brokerage has raised its standalone EPS estimates for FY26, FY27, and FY28 by 2.8%, 7.4%, and 7.6%, respectively, reflecting improved growth expectations. It has also upgraded its FY26 standalone loan growth forecast to 34% year-on-year from 26% earlier, projecting a 10% quarter-on-quarter rise in gold loans in 3QFY26. Meanwhile, the average NIM estimate for FY26–28 has been slightly trimmed to 11.0% from 11.1%, while operating costs to average AUM have been lowered to 2.7% from 2.9%, indicating better operational efficiency. Credit cost assumptions remain unchanged. Morgan Stanley has now incorporated Muthoot Money (AUM ~Rs 5,000 crore) into its sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, which, along with the upward earnings revisions, drives a 9.5–10% uplift in the SOTP-based target and scenario values for the company.Motilal Oswal on Tata Elxsi: Sell | Target Rs 4,400 (vs Rs 4,450) Motilal Oswal has maintained a ‘Sell’ rating on Tata Elxsi with a revised target price of Rs 4,400 (earlier 4,450). The brokerage noted that while the company’s revenue performance was in line with expectations, there was a miss on margins, with growth primarily driven by the Media \u0026 Communications segment. It expects revenue to grow by around 4% in the second half of FY26, while EBIT and PAT are likely to decline by 9% and 4% year-on-year, respectively. The report highlights that muted technology spending in the Automotive and Media verticals continues to weigh on near-term momentum. Furthermore, margins, once a key strength for Tata Elxsi, remain under pressure, reflecting challenges in sustaining profitability amid a subdued demand environment.

    "content": "Shares of Tata Consultancy Services edged lower by 1.5% to their day's low of Rs 3,014 per share on the NSE on Friday after India’s largest IT services exporter posted a weaker-than-expected September-quarter profit but announced an ambitious foray into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. While the results fell short of analysts’ estimates, several brokerages maintained bullish views, citing long-term strategic positioning and new growth levers that could lift the stock by as much as 21% from its last close.TCS on Thursday reported a 1.4% rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 12,075 crore for the quarter ended September 2025, compared with Rs 11,909 crore a year earlier, missing Street estimates of Rs 12,573 crore. Revenue rose 2.4% year-on-year to Rs 65,799 crore, slightly above expectations, and grew 3.7% sequentially.The company announced a second interim dividend of Rs 11 per share, with October 15 as the record date and payment slated for November 4. Operating margin expanded 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 25.2%, while cash flow from operations stood at 110% of net income.Chief Executive Officer K. Krithivasan said, “We are on a journey to become the world’s largest AI-led technology services company.” He said that investments in AI infrastructure underscore the company’s commitment to this transformation.TCS shares closed 1.2% higher at Rs 3,061.95 on Thursday before the results were released after market hours.Also read | Explained: Reliance Industries is India’s most valuable company but why isn’t it No.1 in Nifty50 weight?What brokerages said:Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs maintained its 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 3,330, implying an upside of nearly 9% from the last close. The brokerage noted that while headcount was down 3% sequentially with another 1% decline expected, the company’s “strategic shift to adapt to the changing tech landscape may offset structural and cyclical pressures.”The brokerage said the new data centre foray, which includes a planned 1 GW capacity over the next five to seven years, and the acquisition of Salesforce partner ListEngage, enhance TCS’s AI and capability-led growth positioning. The brokerage, however, kept its FY26 revenue growth forecast unchanged at -1.4% year-on-year, calling the results a “neutral read-through” for the broader IT services sector.Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley retained an 'overweight' rating on TCS with a target price of Rs 3,690, reflecting a potential upside of around 20.5%. The brokerage said that revenue, recurring EBIT, and recurring net income beat estimates by 0.8%, 2.8%, and 3.3%, respectively.The brokerage highlighted that TCS’s constant-currency revenue grew 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, outperforming expectations, with 60% of the beat driven by domestic business and 40% by international operations. Morgan Stanley said the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary for AI and sovereign data centres, alongside the acquisition of a Salesforce partner for $72.8 million, reinforced management’s push toward next-generation tech services.Also read | 15 stocks to shop for this Diwali; SBI Securities eyes up to 25% upside. Check listMotilal OswalMotilal Oswal maintained its 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 3,500, offering a potential upside of about 14%. The brokerage said that while the quarter was in line with expectations, “it’s too early to assess the data centre foray” and that “core growth remains modest.”It expects TCS’s revenue, EBIT, and PAT to grow 5.8%, 7.8%, and 7.5% year-on-year, respectively, in the second half of FY26. The brokerage added that clarity on “capital structure, capex schedule, rentals, and MOU for the data centre” would be key to evaluating the initiative’s long-term value.NuvamaNuvama Institutional Equities reiterated its 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 3,650, implying a potential upside of nearly 19%. The brokerage described TCS’s Q2 as a “decent quarter,” noting that the plan to set up a 1 GW AI data centre marks a “strategic move” aligned with evolving enterprise demand.However, it trimmed its FY26 and FY27 earnings per share estimates by around 2% each, citing lower growth assumptions. “Near-term volatility is expected,” the brokerage said, but it maintained that “the long-term outlook remains strong.”Also read | TCS Q2 results: Top 10 takeaways from September quarter earnings(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "title": "TCS' AI-skilled workforce doubles to 1.6 lakh; 18,500 new hires in Q2 with focus on future-ready skills",
    "content": "India’s largest IT services company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), is making a major pivot towards artificial intelligence (AI) and digital infrastructure, with plans to invest $5–6 billion over the next few years in building data centres and AI capabilities. The company aims to transform itself into the world’s largest AI-led technology services firm, said Samir Seksaria, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of TCS.TCS is reskilling its workforce for the next phase of technology, focusing on high-skill, high-intensity digital roles and has already doubled its AI-skilled workforce to 1.6 lakh.Speaking to ET Now, Seksaria and Sudeep Kunnumal, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), shared insights into the company’s AI transition strategy, investments, and workforce transformation plans.TCS to set up 1-Gigawatt AI data centre capacityAs part of its AI expansion, TCS plans to create one gigawatt (GW) of data centre capacity over the next few years — a significant move into digital infrastructure that will support AI training, cloud computing, and enterprise services.“We will begin with a 150-megawatt phase requiring an investment of around $1 billion, which will become operational in the next 14–18 months,” Seksaria said. “The capacity will gradually scale up to one gigawatt over time.”The total investment, estimated between $5 billion and $6 billion, will be structured through a combination of equity and debt, with potential participation from strategic equity partners.“It will start as a wholly owned subsidiary and, over time, we may bring in a strategic partner to scale the business,” Seksaria confirmed.The planned data centres will focus on AI and sovereign cloud infrastructure, serving both TCS’s enterprise clients and other hyperscalers.Five pillars of TCS’s AI transformationTCS’s transition toward an AI-led model is being guided by what the management calls the company’s “five transformation pillars.” These pillars will shape its investments, workforce strategy, and client engagement over the next few years:Internal transformation:TCS aims to embed AI into every internal function — from operations to decision-making — to enhance efficiency and productivity. Employees are being given access to AI tools and platforms to encourage innovation.Redefining services:The company has created a new AI Business Unit, focusing on talent acquisition, reskilling, and a “human + AI” service delivery model.Becoming future ready:TCS is reskilling its workforce for the next phase of technology, focusing on high-skill, high-intensity digital roles to stay ahead of global tech trends.AI for clients:TCS is working closely with clients through “AI Innovation Days” and short-cycle delivery models — 8-to-12-week AI projects that demonstrate tangible business outcomes before scaling.Ecosystem play and partnerships:Beyond its in-house efforts, TCS is deepening partnerships with niche AI players, hyperscalers, and enterprise tech companies. The company has already announced an acquisition in the Salesforce domain and is exploring further inorganic growth opportunities.Transforming into an AI-first technology companyTCS’s move to become an AI-first technology company is not an overnight shift, Seksaria emphasized.“This is a journey. We’ve been investing in AI, cloud, and data for years, but now we are accelerating to the next level,” he said. “There are short-term steps such as restructuring and talent readiness, and longer-term initiatives like ecosystem expansion.”He added that every client project will increasingly have AI integrated — whether for improving productivity, speeding up delivery, or enhancing end-user experience.AI workforce doubles to 1.6 lakh employeesThe company’s HR transformation is just as significant as its infrastructure and business model changes.According to CHRO Sudeep Kunnumal, TCS’s AI and machine learning (ML) talent base has more than doubled over the past year.“Our deep-tech talent pool in AI and ML was around 70,000 last year; today it stands at 160,000 employees,” Kunnumal said. “We’ve democratized access to AI infrastructure across offices so employees can experiment, learn, and build solutions.”TCS has been conducting large-scale AI learning initiatives, including hackathons and internal innovation challenges. “Every employee now has access to AI learning platforms. Learning hours have doubled over the past year,” Kunnumal added.18,500 new hires in Q2, Focus on future-ready skillsDespite restructuring in parts of its workforce, TCS continues to hire aggressively in future-facing areas.“We hired 18,500 people globally this quarter — that’s our gross hiring — across markets, focusing on future-ready digital and AI skills,” Kunnumal confirmed.The company has also reaffirmed its commitment to onboarding all campus recruits with prior offers.On reports about layoffs, Kunnumal clarified:“We are restructuring certain areas but have honoured all offers and are on track to onboard them. The narrative around layoffs is exaggerated.”Long-term vision: AI-enabled growth and new revenue mixTCS expects its AI-led transformation to not only redefine its internal processes but also reshape its revenue mix over time. The company envisions a model where AI-enabled projects form a significant share of future growth.“Every project we undertake will increasingly have an AI component — whether for automation, analytics, or transformation,” Seksaria said.The company’s aim is clear: to emerge as a global leader in AI-led digital services, blending deep technology expertise with a scalable infrastructure base.",

    "title": "State Bank of India plans rupee debt sale after year-long hiatus, sources say",
    "content": "India's largest bank is set to return to the rupee debt market after a year with plans to raise funds through Basel III-compliant tier II bonds this month, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. State Bank of India is in advanced stages of issuing the bonds with a 10-year duration to raise as much as 75 billion rupees (about $845.7 million), the sources said. The lender may invite bids before the end of the month, they added. SBI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media. The bonds will have a call option at the end of five years, and at the end of every year thereafter, the sources said.  \"The issue would be priced as per a five-year instrument, and currently, there is sufficient gap between five-year and 10-year bond yields, which must have pushed them towards the shorter tenor,\" one of the sources said. Merchant bankers said that mutual funds could bid aggressively for the issue. SBI had planned the tier II bond issue by August but delayed it due to the rise in yields. The bank also shelved an infrastructure bond issue in March due to elevated yields. ($1 = 88.6870 Indian rupees)",

    "title": "TCS bets big on AI and data centres; every project will be AI-led, says CEO K Krithivasan",
    "content": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is doubling down on its artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation strategy while expanding into adjacencies such as data centres and sovereign cloud infrastructure. The company’s leadership says this multi-pronged approach will position TCS as the world’s largest AI-led technology services provider in the coming years.In an interaction with ET Now, K Krithivasan, CEO \u0026 Managing Director, and Aarthi Subramanian, Executive Director, President \u0026 COO, outlined how the company’s internal transformation, client engagement model, and growth strategy are being reshaped around AI and emerging digital ecosystems.AI at the core of TCS’s transformationTCS, India’s largest IT services exporter, has embarked on an ambitious plan to make every layer of its business “AI-led.”Krithivasan said the company’s vision rests on five key pillars — internal transformation, AI-infused services, workforce upskilling, evolving business models, and expansion into adjacencies like data centres and sovereign cloud.“We are investing heavily in building platforms, training our people, and creating infrastructure to lead in AI,” he said. “If we have to reach our rightful place, we need to transform internally, embed AI into every client service, and expand into areas that strengthen our presence in the global AI ecosystem.”The company has already trained over 1.6 lakh employees in AI tools and processes. “Our workforce transformation is key to ensuring that every TCS employee becomes an AI practitioner,” he added.AI-first culture: World’s largest hackathonCEO Aarthi Subramanian highlighted TCS’s push to create an AI-first culture across its global operations. Over the past quarter, the company provided AI access to more than 600,000 employees and organised the world’s largest AI hackathon, where 280,000 employees participated over an eight-week period to build AI-led solutions.“All of us, including the leadership team, got hands-on with AI,” Subramanian said. “The hackathon was part of driving an AI-first mindset — we want every employee to experiment, innovate, and co-create with AI.”She added that TCS is redefining every service line with a “human-plus-AI” operating model, combining human creativity and judgment with machine intelligence for faster, more scalable outcomes.Every project now has an AI componentTCS’s leadership said nearly every client engagement today incorporates AI in some form — whether for improving productivity, accelerating delivery, or enhancing customer value.“It’s becoming difficult to find a project that doesn’t have an AI element,” Krithivasan said. “Our ambition is that every TCS project will be AI-led, either through automation, analytics, or AI-enabled delivery.”Subramanian added that embedding AI into all operations is no longer optional.“To be competitive in today’s environment, you must make AI part of every interaction and every workflow,” she said.Strong deal wins and outcome-based projectsTCS reported $10 billion in total contract value (TCV) for the quarter, with a healthy mix of large, multi-year projects and shorter, outcome-driven engagements.“We now have rapid build projects that last 8–16 weeks, alongside traditional multi-year contracts — but every engagement now has AI built into it,” said Krithivasan.He cited the company’s recent Tryg Insurance deal as an example of how AI is being integrated end-to-end — from IT operations to application development and transformation.TCS is also conducting “AI Innovation Days” with clients, where teams co-create and test use cases in real time to convert hype into measurable business value.Demand environment improving graduallyWhile macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, TCS sees early signs of recovery in global tech spending.“Discretionary demand is slowly improving,” Krithivasan said. “Earlier we spoke about project deferments and cancellations — those have reduced. As trade deals get signed and confidence returns, we expect spending to pick up.”For the quarter, TCS reported constant currency revenue growth of 0.8%, improved operating margins by 70 basis points, and added over 18,000 employees. Despite wage hikes and severance costs, the company maintained profitability, supported by cost discipline and efficiency measures.Sectoral outlook: BFSI leads, UK weakensThe BFSI segment continues to perform well globally, especially in North America, which remains TCS’s largest market. However, UK revenues declined due to a pricing adjustment in one of its long-term insurance contracts.“The UK drop was linked to a scheduled price reduction under a per-policy model — a one-off adjustment,” Krithivasan clarified.Expanding into data centres and sovereign cloudOne of TCS’s biggest strategic moves this year is its expansion into data centre operations — a segment with massive potential in India.Krithivasan said the company’s decision is driven by both business opportunity and the need to deepen its participation in the AI value chain.“India currently has around 1.2 gigawatts of data centre capacity, but demand is expected to grow to 10 gigawatts in the next five years,” he said. “We plan to add one gigawatt of data centre capacity over the next five to seven years.”The company is also developing a sovereign, secure cloud offering to cater to Indian enterprises and government entities. These initiatives, he said, will strengthen TCS’s ecosystem partnerships with hyperscalers and AI players while opening new revenue streams.AI everywhere: The road aheadWith a strong order book, improving demand outlook, and a rapidly advancing AI transformation, TCS is positioning itself for sustainable growth.“Our goal is clear — every project we do will be AI-led,” Krithivasan reiterated. “We are embedding AI into everything we do — from internal processes to customer solutions — to redefine what it means to be a technology services company.”Subramanian echoed this sentiment, saying AI would not just be a technology shift but a cultural transformation at TCS.“We are building an organisation where humans and AI collaborate to deliver outcomes faster, smarter, and better,” she said.Key highlightsTCS aims to become the world’s largest AI-led services company.$10 billion TCV in Q2; most deals have AI components.600,000+ employees given AI access; 280,000 joined AI hackathon.Plans to build 1 GW data centre capacity in India.BFSI and North America drive growth; UK slowdown temporary.Margins expand 70 bps despite wage hikes.",

    "title": "TCS results, AI bets and metals rally: Parag Thakkar sees value across IT, metals and banking sector",
    "content": "In an exclusive conversation with ET Now, Parag Thakkar, from Fort Capital shared his perspective on Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS) latest quarterly results, the company’s strategic shift towards AI and data centre investments, and his bullish stance on the metals and banking sectors. “We have 2.5% weight in TCS and we are not going to sell at this price,” Thakkar began, making his position clear. “Whether we will add more depends... See, the two-three things which are positive is first of all the result was positive. 0.8% CC growth, 25.2% margin in spite of one month of wage hike impact; deal wins were very good, $10 billion; plus a commentary that project cancellations and deferrals have stopped; H2 is looking better.” According to Thakkar, the current valuation leaves little reason to exit. “Considering the fact that stock is now trading at only 20 times FY27 earnings expected EPS of Rs 150, I would not sell the stock for sure.” When asked about TCS’s investment push towards data centres and AI, Thakkar dismissed concerns over free cash flow diversion. “See, data centre, I will say that one gigawatt which is $6 to $7 billion over next five to seven years and that too with a partner who will be investing equity also and they will be partly funded through debt also. So, I would say, it is not a big strain on a balance sheet which has 50,000 crore cash already, plus it generates 50,000 crore of profits every year which is free cash flow.” He added that market perceptions of capital allocation often miss the broader context. “When Infosys did buyback, people said that Indian companies are still rewarding shareholders by doing buybacks, while others are investing. Now when TCS is investing, you cannot have both views right. Either of the two can be right.” For Thakkar, TCS’s move represents a long-term strategic evolution. “If TCS is able to showcase good execution there, if they are able to tell to market that who are the main clients, whether the entire data centre plan is completely being booked or leased out, those things are very important; plus it will improve the relationship with their customers like AWS or Salesforce because now they are investing in physical infrastructure also for them, not only providing services. So, I do not think that any of their decisions are wrong and so I am not a seller for sure.” Turning to the metals space, Thakkar expressed continued optimism. “Metal stocks generally move in tandem with the metal prices. So, we have seen that Hindalco has moved from say 650 to 770 and aluminium prices on LME has also moved from say $2,500 to now closer to $2,740, $2,760,” he noted. “One of the reason is the weakness in dollar because you are going to expect rate cuts in US, so basically one of the good reason is dollar index falling and the other reason is, of course, China putting cap on its capacities.” He highlighted that government protection and domestic fundamentals make Indian metal companies attractive. “In aluminium they do not produce above 45 million tonnes and, of course, in steel safeguard duty and all has protected Indian steel company. So, I am constructive on the sector, overweight on the sector and with large position in Hindalco and some position in Tata Steel and I would like to hold on.” Thakkar sees long-term triggers in play. “In Hindalco I see multiple long-term triggers, like they have got the coal mines in place now which will increase their aluminium ebitda per tonne over next two years, then Novelis new plant will start next year where the average realization will improve significantly, that is what they have guided, $600 per tonne ebitda. So, I would like to hold on to Hindalco and Tata Steels of the world in metal space.” On the banking front, Thakkar expects strong earnings momentum ahead. “What I feel is this is a phase of the margin, maximum margin contraction which I expect on core basis is 5 to 9 bps in both cases. From here on due to GST cut-led surge in demand, the credit growth is only going to increase. Margins will also gradually inch up because of deposit repricing and CRR cut and I am seeing a very fantastic next year for banks like HDFC and ICICI and SBI also which have a pristine asset quality track record.” He also underscored the prudence of large banks in provisioning. “ECL provisioning and that has been a point of discussion after RBI policy, there also a prudent bank like HDFC Bank has done a huge contingency provision when they came out with IPO of HDB Financial Services and raised 9,000 crores, instead of booking it in P\u0026L, they did a contingency buffer which will come to help if they have to do any provisioning on ECL front, so that will also protect them.” Valuations, he said, remain comfortable. “At two times price to book, 15 PE is no longer expensive. So, I would say that we have a very large weight in HDFC, ICICI, and SBI in our portfolio and we would continue to hold on.” From IT to metals and banking, Thakkar’s stance remains clear — fundamentals and long-term value are still intact across sectors, even as markets digest short-term shifts in strategy and sentiment.",

    "title": "TCS taking a balanced, low risk Path on AI Investments: Sandip Agarwal",
    "content": "India’s largest software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has announced a $7 billion investment in data centres and AI-linked infrastructure — a move that marks one of its most ambitious strategic shifts in recent years. The announcement comes alongside a 3% fall in employee headcount, which the company attributes to efficiency gains from automation and AI integration.Speaking to ET Now, Sandip Agarwal, from Sowilo Investment Managers, said he was not concerned about the decline in staff numbers.“I am not at all surprised with the fall in employee count because in my opinion there must be rationalization of employee across IT services companies,” he said.“AI itself means that your efforts will go down by 30-40%, so you cannot keep adding people when your efforts are going down, so that is actually a positive and not a negative for any company in the sector.”He added that rationalising the workforce is essential for maintaining profitability and competitiveness in an AI-driven era.“Everyone must rationalize their workforce to maintain their profitability and growth,” Agarwal noted.Muted Growth Expectations for FY26–27Agarwal cautioned investors against expecting a sharp rebound in the next fiscal year.“FY26 you will not see any big numbers, even in FY27 I think from IT services expecting largecap to be more than 6-7% growth is too much,” he said.“The largecap IT companies would not see more than mid-single to high-single digit growth and for that growth the multiples are quite decent or maybe, I would say, relatively higher.”He also highlighted that new revenue streams from emerging technologies will take time to contribute meaningfully to topline growth.Data Centres Seen as a Strategic ExtensionOn TCS’s $7 billion data centre investment, Agarwal struck an optimistic tone, calling it a “very good and positive” step.“These companies have much higher advantage than anyone else who is coming into the data centre business,” he said. “They have the technical knowhow, a strong balance sheet, and a cash cow in their services business.”However, he warned that such projects have long gestation periods.“Numbers will take time to come because you know data centres take 18 to 24 months when they start contributing to revenue,” Agarwal explained. “Margins may be a little lower but at least it is much better than doing the buybacks which they were doing.”He further noted that small acquisitions could help TCS strengthen its AI and infrastructure capabilities.“Rather than doing buyback, extending into related areas is a much better thing and obviously when you start that then you can do small-small acquisitions which can keep on adding on your capabilities.”TCS Takes the Middle Path on ReturnsCommenting on the potential impact of the investment on return ratios, Agarwal said TCS had opted for a balanced approach.“There was one path where you go aggressive in R\u0026D and start building AI capabilities which would have burned $20, $30, $40 billion… and the other path was distributing that money for buyback or dividend,” he said.“In the middle there was a path where you are not going to burn money like that and that was this business which they have announced where you are certain of making returns.”He believes this strategy ensures better use of capital.“Returns could be less or more, but at least it will be much higher than what they would be doing by keeping the money in banks and getting 6-7% return which is also taxable.”Sector-Wide ImplicationsAccording to Agarwal, TCS’s move could inspire similar capital allocation strategies across India’s top IT players.“The natural read through for everyone will be that whoever has a huge cash balance — whether it is Infosys, HCL, or Wipro — they will all take this path,” he said. “We have huge demand which will come for data centre in next 5, 7, 10 years and these companies honestly I believe are much better placed than the other data centre, local players who are coming.”He described TCS’s decision as a “low-risk, right step” compared with other capital deployment options.“This is a good step and this is the right thing to do and this step has much lower risk than any other step they would have taken.”‘Good Use of Cash’ Even Without High GrowthWhile he does not issue formal price targets, Agarwal maintained that such strategic capital deployment improves the quality of growth in large-cap IT firms.“We believe that largecap IT sector on their own IT services there will not be more than 5-7% growth, but this kind of action which they have taken to utilise cash is really good in my opinion,” he concluded.",

    "title": "TCS bets $6 billion on AI data centers: Bold pivot or costly detour?",
    "content": "India's IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services has kicked off one of its most ambitious bets yet — a $6 billion foray into artificial intelligence infrastructure that marks a decisive pivot from its traditional services-led model toward the capital-heavy world of AI data centres. Just when India's IT services giants were being blamed widely for having been left out in the AI boom, TCS declared ambitions to become the world's largest AI-led technology services company.The company plans to build a sovereign, co-location AI data centre of up to 1 GW capacity in India over the next five to seven years through a new subsidiary. But with returns uncertain and synergies with its core services unclear, the $6 billion question is whether this bold leap will redefine TCS's growth story or test its financial discipline.Analysts remain split. Some call it a strategic move to future-proof the business as global AI demand explodes; others warn it's a low-margin, high-capex detour that could dilute TCS's stellar return profile.The initiative signals a rare shift in strategy for the usually conservative IT giant, putting its balance sheet to work at a time when the industry is chasing AI scale. TCS will follow a co-location model, where it will provide the passive infrastructure and clients will bring in compute and storage. The company expects the capital intensity to be approximately $1 billion per 150 MW, with funding to be structured through a mix of equity and debt, supported by financial partners, TCS said in an analyst call after declaring its Q2 numbers on Thursday.Management said the first phase will become operational in 18–24 months, with initial anchor clients from hyperscalers, deep-tech AI firms, Indian enterprises, and sovereign projects. TCS noted that India's current installed data-centre capacity stands at approximately 1.2 GW, but demand could expand nearly 10x in the next five to six years, while committed capacity is only 5–6 GW, creating a significant revenue opportunity.Also Read | Is the AI boom becoming a bubble? Why Goldman, JPMorgan, IMF are sounding the alarmDalal Street isn't entirely convinced. Akshat Agarwal of Jefferies said the move was surprising for three reasons. First, it doesn't materially change TCS's growth profile since at full potential in FY31, revenues from the business will be approximately $1.2 billion and add only 0.6% revenue CAGR over FY25-31. Second, it's a physical infrastructure leasing business with little relationship to TCS's existing IT service business. Third, it's a capex-heavy, low ROCE (8–12%) business, quite the opposite of TCS's current business.Jefferies maintained its Hold rating with a price target of Rs 3,100 based on 21x PE, cutting FY26–28 EPS estimates by up to 1% and expecting only a 4% EPS CAGR over FY26–28E. The firm noted it has not modeled the impact of the data centre foray in its numbers, though the likely impact on free cash flow and payouts may be less than 10% due to the use of debt funding.Motilal Oswal highlighted that TCS will not run cloud workloads or provide managed cloud services — the data centre will function as a sovereign co-location site. \"This means low technology intensity, limited overlap with TCS's core services portfolio, and hence minimal direct synergies,\" the brokerage noted.The firm added that ROE at the subsidiary level will be lower than TCS's over 50% group ROE, given the capital-intensive nature. However, management guided that at the consolidated level, it will not be margin-dilutive, as external partners will share funding. Motilal Oswal said the move is \"best viewed as cash deployment rather than a services-led growth driver.\"Also Read | TCS Q2 Results: Cons PAT rises 1.4% YoY to Rs 12,075 crore, misses street estimatesNomura questioned the return profile, noting it is \"unclear to us how the ROEs of this business will be similar to existing business RoE of ~50% given its capex-heavy nature with IRRs at ~20%.\"However, not everyone is bearish. Nuvama called the decision \"a balanced one, as it explores growth opportunities in the tech ecosystem, with manageable capital commitment (for TCS's balance sheet size) and decent returns profile (though lower than its own).\" The brokerage acknowledged TCS is \"deploying significant capital, in high-growth but lower RoCE business, than its own,\" but views it as an acceptable trade-off.JM Financial struck the most bullish tone, calling the co-location foray \"value accretive,\" though it sees \"limited synergies with its Services business at this stage.\" Importantly, the brokerage said, \"TCS' willingness to put its balance sheet to use, a significant deviation from its earlier conservative approach, is a welcome change in the current dynamic environment. Investors should encourage this.\" JM Financial maintained its Buy rating.The Five Pillars of AI StrategyBeyond the data centre, management laid out five pillars of its AI strategy: making TCS AI-first by enabling employees to learn, experiment, and embed AI in daily work; redefining every service line under a \"human + AI\" delivery blueprint; building a future-ready talent model by investing in future-ready skills and recruiting top talent locally; making AI real for clients through rapid builds, AI labs and offices, and value-chain solutions across industries; and strengthening ecosystem partnerships while stepping up efforts in M\u0026A and scaling AI platforms — including the recent acquisition of ListEngage.The company is targeting an annuity stream of revenue from pure-play AI players, deep-tech, hyperscalers, and private and government enterprises in India.While TCS posted a decent quarter on low expectations, its decision to invest in an AI data centre takes it to an interesting crossroad — one where its legendary financial discipline meets the capital-hungry demands of the AI era. Whether this gamble pays off may define the company's next chapter.",

It added that the business outlook for the company is challenged and that the asset intensity in data centers will only increase as the years go by.Goldman Sachs\nGoldman Sachs has maintained its \"buy\" rating on TCS with a price target of ₹3,300.\n\nIt said that TCS' data centers announcement could translate into 15% to 20% of India's overall data center capacity.\n\n\"TCS is stepping up acquisitions, which it has historically stayed away from, to enhance capabilities, including in AI,\" the brokerage said.\nThe brokerage sees a \"neutral\" read-through for the rest of the Indian IT companies after TCS' results.CLSA\nCLSA also maintained its \"outperform\" rating on the stock with a price target of ₹3,559. The brokerage said that the quarter was a beat on all fronts with broad-based growth and UK and retail being the remaining pain points.\n\n\"More importantly, TCS is showing clear signs of aggression with proactive decisions around restructuring its workforce to make it AI ready, being more acquisitive in future around technologies in demand and plans to create 1GW of data centre capacity over the next 5-7 years,\" CLSA said.\n\nThe brokerage added that the capex push will offer more vertically integrated technology solutions and drive earnings growth, but will alter its Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) and Free Cash Flow / Net Profit profile.Nomura\nNomura has maintained its \"neutral\" rating on the stock with a price target of ₹3,300.\n\nIt said that the foray into data centers will increase its presence in the AI ecosystem, however, a significant margin improvement is unlikely.\n\nThe brokerage also added that it remains unclear as to how the Return on Equity (RoE) of the data center business will be similar to the existing business RoE of over 50%, as it is capex-heavy in nature.Jefferies\nJefferies has maintained its \"hold\" rating on TCS with a price target of ₹3,100.\n\nIt said that growth in key markets is yet to recover, and that a 3% sequential decline in headcount does not bode well for the company.\n\nTCS' data center foray has limited synergies with IT Services, according to Jefferies, and as a result, it has cut its estimates by up to 1% and expects TCS' Earnings Per Share (EPS) to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4% over financial year 2026-2028.\n\nOut of the 51 analysts that have coverage on TCS, 33 have a \"buy\" rating, 13 say \"hold\", while five have a \"sell\" recommendation.\n\nShares of TCS have gained in three out of the four trading sessions this week, continuing their rebound from the 52-week low that the stock fell to on October 1. The stock ended near the day's high on Thursday as well ahead of the results announcement.\n\nTo be updated with more.First Published: Oct 10, 2025 7:24 AM IST",

Although the index made a lower high on the charts on Thursday, it made a higher low, and also managed to sustain above the 56,000 mark, which remains level on the downside for the index.While writing the setup for Thursday's trade, we told you about how Tuesday's and Wednesday's sessions were exact replicas on the Nifty 50 charts. Intraday recoveries getting sold into and dips getting bought. Thursday was the reverse of that trend.\n\nSimilar to the last two sessions, the Nifty gave both the bulls and the bears equal opportunity. But unlike the last two sessions, the index ended near the day's high instead of ending at the day's low.\n\nIt may only have been a small margin, but the Nifty did manage to make a higher high and a higher low on the charts in today's session. All sectoral indices ended higher on Thursday, led by Metals, IT and Pharma, with the IT index now gaining 5% so far in the four trading sessions of the week so far.\nIT stocks will continue to remain in focus after TCS results. Two possibilities emerge after the results that surpassed expectations on most fronts - One being that the stock sees some profit booking considering it has gained in three out of the last four trading sessions. Second probability being that considering that the stock is already beaten down and is a major underperformer this year, the recovery from the 52-week lows may just continue.\n\nIn response to TCS' results, the US-listed shares or ADRs of both Infosys and Wipro are trading with gains of up to 1% each.\n\nThe surge in IT stocks has taken the spotlight away from the Nifty Bank, which has remained away from the limelight for a better part of this week. Although the index made a lower high on the charts on Thursday, it made a higher low, and also managed to sustain above the 56,000 mark, which remains level on the downside for the index. On the upside, the 56,280 - 56,300 zone continues to remain a barrier. The Nifty Bank needs to close above 55,589 to also report its fifth weekly gain in the last six weeks.\n\n\"The shorter-term moving averages continue to display strength, with a bullish crossover of the 9-EMA and 20-EMA over the 50-EMA, confirming the continuation of the near-term uptrend. The RSI has inched up to 63, reflecting sustained momentum. A close above 56,300 could open the door for a further move toward 56,550–56,700,\" Om Mehra of SAMCO Securities said.\n\n\"The support remains in the 55,900–55,800 zone. The index remains resilient, and as long as 55,800 holds this level, the short-term tone is likely to stay bullish, with a preference to add on declines,\" he added.\n\nThe Nifty has now gained in five out of the last six trading sessions and is set for a weekly advance as well. The index needs to close above the 24,894 mark to register it fifth weekly advance in the last six weeks. The first important level to watch on the upside for the Nifty is Tuesday's swing high of 25,220. The index continues to find support between the 25,000 - 25,050 levels, and that continues to remain the key level on any potential dip.\n\n\"The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. A decisive move above 25,200 levels could pull Nifty towards another resistance of 25,450 levels in the next few sessions. Immediate support is placed at 25000 levels,\" said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.\n\nShrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities believes that the 25,200 - 25,250 zone will continue to be an immediate hurdle for the bulls. A breakout above that zone could take the index back to its recent highs of 25,450 or maybe even 25,500, he added.",

This marks its renewed push into India’s personal care market.\n\nThe new Velvette range will include soaps, shampoos, conditioners, body wash, and talcum powders, and will be rolled out first in Tamil Nadu before expanding to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana by December. A nationwide launch is planned for next year.\n\n“We felt Velvette was a good place to start building a personal care brand. We’ve taken the traditional formulation and built on it. It will be available on top outlets of Tamil Nadu in the next 4 weeks,\" T. Krishnakumar, Director, RCPL told CNBC-TV18..\n\nThe revival of Velvette comes as RCPL accelerates its plans to become a full-scale FMCG player. The company, part of Reliance Retail Ventures, is expanding its portfolio across personal care, homecare, beverages, and packaged foods, and aims to build at least five brands with annual revenues of ₹1,000 crore each by the end of 2027.\n\n“By this time next year, every category will be available nationally,” Krishnakumar said.\n\nRCPL’s existing portfolio includes staples, snacks, biscuits, and homecare products, with new categories such as ready-to-cook, ready-to-eat, and general merchandise in the pipeline. Within general merchandise, the company plans to focus on cleaning aids, a segment with few organised players.\n\nIn beverages, RCPL is introducing Campa Sure, a packaged water brand priced at ₹15 for a one-litre bottle. Positioned under the Campa umbrella for instant brand recognition, Krishnakumar said Campa Sure aims to deliver affordable drinking water while reducing logistics costs through collaborations with local manufacturers. \n\n\n\nThe first bottles will hit the market in North India within three days. Starting with UP, followed by markets like NCR, Jammu Kashmir, etc, a pan-India rollout is expected over the next six months.\n\nKrishnakumar said affordability remains central to RCPL’s strategy. “If you want to build distribution, the mass of India lies in the realm of affordability. Our products are excellent—the same quality or better than those serving premium consumers today,” he said, adding that RCPL’s approach to premiumisation is about “offering more value, not charging a higher price.”\n\nRCPL’s distribution focus remains firmly on general trade, which Krishnakumar described as the company’s “anchor.” He added that RCPL will also expand through institutional channels like railway and canteen stores while building an omnichannel presence.\n\nWith Velvette marking its re-entry into personal care and Campa Sure strengthening its beverage play, RCPL is positioning itself to scale rapidly across India’s mass FMCG market—with an eye on building multiple ₹1,000-crore brands within the next two years.\nNote To ReadersDisclosure: Network18, the parent company of CNBCTV18.com, is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.",

The stock, which opened at ₹3,050 against the previous close of ₹3,061.70, has recorded a traded volume of 63.45 lakh shares worth ₹1,925.53 crore. JM Financial maintains a ‘Buy’ rating with a target price of ₹3,520, highlighting TCS’s operational performance that has exceeded expectations. The firm noted sequential revenue growth of 0.8 per cent in constant currency terms and a 70 basis points expansion in operating margins to 25.2 per cent. Deal wins improved 16 per cent year-on-year to $10 billion, with a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x. The brokerage upgraded its FY26-28 earnings estimates by 2 per cent, citing improved cost management through a 3 per cent sequential headcount reduction. Axis Securities has assigned a ‘Buy’ recommendation with a target of ₹3,460, valuing the stock at 22x FY27 estimated earnings. The firm emphasised TCS’s strategic pivot towards becoming an AI-led technology services company, backed by its decision to build a 1GW AI data-center capacity in India, with an investment of approximately $7 billion over five to seven years. For the quarter ended September 30, TCS reported revenue of ₹65,799 crore, up 3.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter, beating the poll estimate of ₹65,114 crore. However, net profit of ₹12,121 crore fell short of the ₹12,528 crore consensus estimate. The company declared a dividend of ₹11 per share with a record date of October 15. TCS also announced the acquisition of US-based ListEngage for up to $72.80 million to strengthen its Salesforce capabilities and Agentic AI offerings. Additionally, the company unveiled plans to create 5,000 new jobs in the UK over the next three years, while launching an AI Experience Zone in London. Both brokerages remain optimistic about TCS’s growth prospects, citing strong deal pipelines, improved international market outlook, and strategic investments in AI infrastructure despite near-term demand challenges.

Since this is high operating leverage business (higher offshore employee base versus peers), margins may drop in FY26E on weak revenues before recovering in FY27E/28E. We factor in 5.1% earnings CAGR in FY25-28E. The multiple has already moderated from the peak of 80x to 48.8X one-year forward. Given muted revenue and earnings growth outlook, this multiple is likely to be challenged, in our view. We maintain Sell with TP unchanged at INR 4,390, based on 30x FY28E P/E.

Most brokerages, including Motilal Oswal, Axis Securities, and Elara Capital, project a sequential decline of around 20 basis points in EBIT margins due to one-month wage hikes, higher investments, and lower utilization, compounded by the absence of a one-time tax refund recorded in Q1. Revenue forecasts vary, with Nuvama and Elara anticipating muted growth of 0.2–0.5% sequentially, while Axis Securities expects a 3.5% rise fueled by BFSI, hi-tech, and currency tailwinds.

    "title": "TCS bets $6 billion on AI data centers: Bold pivot or costly detour?",
    "content": "India's IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services has kicked off one of its most ambitious bets yet — a $6 billion foray into artificial intelligence infrastructure that marks a decisive pivot from its traditional services-led model toward the capital-heavy world of AI data centres. Just when India's IT services giants were being blamed widely for having been left out in the AI boom, TCS declared ambitions to become the world's largest AI-led technology services company.The company plans to build a sovereign, co-location AI data centre of up to 1 GW capacity in India over the next five to seven years through a new subsidiary. But with returns uncertain and synergies with its core services unclear, the $6 billion question is whether this bold leap will redefine TCS's growth story or test its financial discipline.Analysts remain split. Some call it a strategic move to future-proof the business as global AI demand explodes; others warn it's a low-margin, high-capex detour that could dilute TCS's stellar return profile.The initiative signals a rare shift in strategy for the usually conservative IT giant, putting its balance sheet to work at a time when the industry is chasing AI scale. TCS will follow a co-location model, where it will provide the passive infrastructure and clients will bring in compute and storage. The company expects the capital intensity to be approximately $1 billion per 150 MW, with funding to be structured through a mix of equity and debt, supported by financial partners, TCS said in an analyst call after declaring its Q2 numbers on Thursday.Management said the first phase will become operational in 18–24 months, with initial anchor clients from hyperscalers, deep-tech AI firms, Indian enterprises, and sovereign projects. TCS noted that India's current installed data-centre capacity stands at approximately 1.2 GW, but demand could expand nearly 10x in the next five to six years, while committed capacity is only 5–6 GW, creating a significant revenue opportunity.Also Read | Is the AI boom becoming a bubble? Why Goldman, JPMorgan, IMF are sounding the alarmDalal Street isn't entirely convinced. Akshat Agarwal of Jefferies said the move was surprising for three reasons. First, it doesn't materially change TCS's growth profile since at full potential in FY31, revenues from the business will be approximately $1.2 billion and add only 0.6% revenue CAGR over FY25-31. Second, it's a physical infrastructure leasing business with little relationship to TCS's existing IT service business. Third, it's a capex-heavy, low ROCE (8–12%) business, quite the opposite of TCS's current business.Jefferies maintained its Hold rating with a price target of Rs 3,100 based on 21x PE, cutting FY26–28 EPS estimates by up to 1% and expecting only a 4% EPS CAGR over FY26–28E. The firm noted it has not modeled the impact of the data centre foray in its numbers, though the likely impact on free cash flow and payouts may be less than 10% due to the use of debt funding.Motilal Oswal highlighted that TCS will not run cloud workloads or provide managed cloud services — the data centre will function as a sovereign co-location site. \"This means low technology intensity, limited overlap with TCS's core services portfolio, and hence minimal direct synergies,\" the brokerage noted.The firm added that ROE at the subsidiary level will be lower than TCS's over 50% group ROE, given the capital-intensive nature. However, management guided that at the consolidated level, it will not be margin-dilutive, as external partners will share funding. Motilal Oswal said the move is \"best viewed as cash deployment rather than a services-led growth driver.\"Also Read | TCS Q2 Results: Cons PAT rises 1.4% YoY to Rs 12,075 crore, misses street estimatesNomura questioned the return profile, noting it is \"unclear to us how the ROEs of this business will be similar to existing business RoE of ~50% given its capex-heavy nature with IRRs at ~20%.\"However, not everyone is bearish. Nuvama called the decision \"a balanced one, as it explores growth opportunities in the tech ecosystem, with manageable capital commitment (for TCS's balance sheet size) and decent returns profile (though lower than its own).\" The brokerage acknowledged TCS is \"deploying significant capital, in high-growth but lower RoCE business, than its own,\" but views it as an acceptable trade-off.JM Financial struck the most bullish tone, calling the co-location foray \"value accretive,\" though it sees \"limited synergies with its Services business at this stage.\" Importantly, the brokerage said, \"TCS' willingness to put its balance sheet to use, a significant deviation from its earlier conservative approach, is a welcome change in the current dynamic environment. Investors should encourage this.\" JM Financial maintained its Buy rating.The Five Pillars of AI StrategyBeyond the data centre, management laid out five pillars of its AI strategy: making TCS AI-first by enabling employees to learn, experiment, and embed AI in daily work; redefining every service line under a \"human + AI\" delivery blueprint; building a future-ready talent model by investing in future-ready skills and recruiting top talent locally; making AI real for clients through rapid builds, AI labs and offices, and value-chain solutions across industries; and strengthening ecosystem partnerships while stepping up efforts in M\u0026A and scaling AI platforms — including the recent acquisition of ListEngage.The company is targeting an annuity stream of revenue from pure-play AI players, deep-tech, hyperscalers, and private and government enterprises in India.While TCS posted a decent quarter on low expectations, its decision to invest in an AI data centre takes it to an interesting crossroad — one where its legendary financial discipline meets the capital-hungry demands of the AI era. Whether this gamble pays off may define the company's next chapter.",

    "title": "Reliance Power shares soar 15%. Here’s what is fuelling the rally",
    "content": "Shares of Reliance Power gained as much as 15% to their day’s high of Rs 50.75 on the NSE on Friday, October 10, amid renewed buying interest and strong volumes. Data showed that around 7 crore equity shares of the company changed hands, compared to its one-week and one-month average trading volumes of 2 crore shares each.Last week, the company received Show Cause Notices from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) related to matters concerning CLE Private Limited. The issue stems from past exposures and disclosures regarding CLE. The company denied any ongoing financial ties, though regulatory scrutiny has drawn market attention, especially as the notices came months after settlements and clarifications were already recorded.Q1 Performance SnapshotAnil Ambani-led Reliance Power reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 44.68 crore for Q1 FY26, a turnaround from a loss of Rs 97.85 crore in the same quarter last year.Revenue from operations fell 5.3% year-on-year to Rs 1,885.58 crore, down from Rs 1,992.23 crore in Q1 FY25, and declined 4.7% sequentially from Rs 1,978.01 crore in Q4 FY25. Total income in Q1 FY26 stood at Rs 2,025 crore, reflecting a 2% decline from Rs 2,069 crore a year earlier.Despite the year-on-year profit recovery, net profit fell 64% quarter-on-quarter, compared with Rs 125.57 crore in the March quarter.Also read: Is the AI boom becoming a bubble? Why Goldman, JPMorgan, IMF are sounding the alarmReliance Power shares have gained over 3% in one month but declined more than 25% in three months. The smallcap stock has risen 21% in six months and 8% so far this year. Over two years, the stock has delivered multibagger returns of 171% and an impressive 1,657% in five years.At about 10:40 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 48.33, higher by 8.73% from the last close on the NSE.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "title": "Buy, Sell or Hold: JM Financial recommends buy on TCS post Q2 results; Motilal Oswal recommends Sell on Ta",
    "content": "Brokerages have released their latest views on key companies across sectors, offering a mix of bullish and cautious tones. JM Financial remains optimistic on TCS, citing strong international growth prospects, margin improvement, and strategic investments in AI and digital infrastructure. Morgan Stanley continues to back Muthoot Finance with an Overweight rating, projecting robust loan growth and improved efficiency metrics. On the other hand, Motilal Oswal has turned cautious on Tata Elxsi, maintaining a Sell call as muted tech spending and margin pressures weigh on near-term performance. Here’s a detailed look at what each brokerage had to say for the next 12 months. We have collated a list of recommendations from top brokerage firms from ETNow and other sources:JM Financial on TCS: Buy | Target Rs 3,520 (vs Rs 3,410) | LTP Rs 3,061 | Upside 15% JM Financial has maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on TCS with a revised target price of Rs 3,520 (earlier 3,410), implying a 15% upside from the current market price of Rs 3,061. The brokerage expects international growth in FY26 to outpace FY25’s modest 0.7% constant currency growth, supported by a leaner base that allows for either margin expansion or reinvestment toward growth initiatives. TCS’s announcement of a 1GW AI Data Centre in India over the next 5–7 years with a USD 7 billion investment underscores its ambition to scale up in high-potential digital infrastructure areas. The company is also focusing on acquisitions across AI, Cloud, and Cybersecurity, reflecting a proactive approach towards future technologies. JM Financial notes that TCS’s bold capital deployment marks a strategic shift from its traditional conservatism. Additionally, a 3% reduction in headcount, with another 1% expected, indicates a durable reset of the cost base. Margins are estimated to rise by 43–74 basis points, leading to 2% EPS upgrades for FY26–28E. The brokerage also highlighted that there is no contribution yet from the data centre business, and the stock currently trades at 21x earnings, leaving room for potential re-rating as new initiatives begin to bear fruit.Morgan Stanley on Muthoot Finance: Overweight | Target Rs 3,660 (vs Rs 3,340) | LTP Rs 3,251 | Upside 12% Morgan Stanley has maintained an ‘Overweight’ rating on Muthoot Finance with a revised target price of Rs 3,660 (earlier 3,340), implying a 12% upside from the current market price of Rs 3,251. The brokerage has raised its standalone EPS estimates for FY26, FY27, and FY28 by 2.8%, 7.4%, and 7.6%, respectively, reflecting improved growth expectations. It has also upgraded its FY26 standalone loan growth forecast to 34% year-on-year from 26% earlier, projecting a 10% quarter-on-quarter rise in gold loans in 3QFY26. Meanwhile, the average NIM estimate for FY26–28 has been slightly trimmed to 11.0% from 11.1%, while operating costs to average AUM have been lowered to 2.7% from 2.9%, indicating better operational efficiency. Credit cost assumptions remain unchanged. Morgan Stanley has now incorporated Muthoot Money (AUM ~Rs 5,000 crore) into its sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, which, along with the upward earnings revisions, drives a 9.5–10% uplift in the SOTP-based target and scenario values for the company.Motilal Oswal on Tata Elxsi: Sell | Target Rs 4,400 (vs Rs 4,450) Motilal Oswal has maintained a ‘Sell’ rating on Tata Elxsi with a revised target price of Rs 4,400 (earlier 4,450). The brokerage noted that while the company’s revenue performance was in line with expectations, there was a miss on margins, with growth primarily driven by the Media \u0026 Communications segment. It expects revenue to grow by around 4% in the second half of FY26, while EBIT and PAT are likely to decline by 9% and 4% year-on-year, respectively. The report highlights that muted technology spending in the Automotive and Media verticals continues to weigh on near-term momentum. Furthermore, margins, once a key strength for Tata Elxsi, remain under pressure, reflecting challenges in sustaining profitability amid a subdued demand environment.

THE ECONOMIC TIMESTop gainers in early trade on Friday. Expert viewsDr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, said the market environment is showing positive signs, highlighting that globally, \"the GAZA peace accord signals end to the conflict and reduction of geopolitical risk from the region.\" On the domestic front, he noted that there are \"indications of a trade deal between US and India with India ‘rebalancing’ its oil purchases.\"Dr. Vijayakumar said these developments, coupled with \"the shift in FII strategy (FIIs were buyers in the cash market in the last three trading days),\" bode well for the market. He said that \"even though valuations continue to be relatively high compared to most other markets, short-covering can take the market higher,\" noting that the short position in the market remains elevated.On market enthusiasm, Dr. Vijayakumar observed that \"a significant market trend is the elevated enthusiasm in the primary market,\" citing that \"the Rs 11,607 crore LG Electronics IPO getting oversubscribed 54 times is the reflection of exuberance in the IPO market.\" He added that refunds from such IPOs \"will add to the liquidity in the market helping the market to move higher.\"Also read: Catch all the stock market action live hereGlobal MarketsAsian stocks edged lower on Friday as Wall Street’s modest declines lingered and commodity markets paused after recent gains.

    "content": "Shares of Tata Consultancy Services edged lower by 1.5% to their day's low of Rs 3,014 per share on the NSE on Friday after India’s largest IT services exporter posted a weaker-than-expected September-quarter profit but announced an ambitious foray into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. While the results fell short of analysts’ estimates, several brokerages maintained bullish views, citing long-term strategic positioning and new growth levers that could lift the stock by as much as 21% from its last close.TCS on Thursday reported a 1.4% rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 12,075 crore for the quarter ended September 2025, compared with Rs 11,909 crore a year earlier, missing Street estimates of Rs 12,573 crore. Revenue rose 2.4% year-on-year to Rs 65,799 crore, slightly above expectations, and grew 3.7% sequentially.The company announced a second interim dividend of Rs 11 per share, with October 15 as the record date and payment slated for November 4. Operating margin expanded 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 25.2%, while cash flow from operations stood at 110% of net income.Chief Executive Officer K. Krithivasan said, “We are on a journey to become the world’s largest AI-led technology services company.” He said that investments in AI infrastructure underscore the company’s commitment to this transformation.TCS shares closed 1.2% higher at Rs 3,061.95 on Thursday before the results were released after market hours.Also read | Explained: Reliance Industries is India’s most valuable company but why isn’t it No.1 in Nifty50 weight?What brokerages said:Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs maintained its 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 3,330, implying an upside of nearly 9% from the last close. The brokerage noted that while headcount was down 3% sequentially with another 1% decline expected, the company’s “strategic shift to adapt to the changing tech landscape may offset structural and cyclical pressures.”The brokerage said the new data centre foray, which includes a planned 1 GW capacity over the next five to seven years, and the acquisition of Salesforce partner ListEngage, enhance TCS’s AI and capability-led growth positioning. The brokerage, however, kept its FY26 revenue growth forecast unchanged at -1.4% year-on-year, calling the results a “neutral read-through” for the broader IT services sector.Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley retained an 'overweight' rating on TCS with a target price of Rs 3,690, reflecting a potential upside of around 20.5%. The brokerage said that revenue, recurring EBIT, and recurring net income beat estimates by 0.8%, 2.8%, and 3.3%, respectively.The brokerage highlighted that TCS’s constant-currency revenue grew 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, outperforming expectations, with 60% of the beat driven by domestic business and 40% by international operations. Morgan Stanley said the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary for AI and sovereign data centres, alongside the acquisition of a Salesforce partner for $72.8 million, reinforced management’s push toward next-generation tech services.Also read | 15 stocks to shop for this Diwali; SBI Securities eyes up to 25% upside.

The brokerage said that while the quarter was in line with expectations, “it’s too early to assess the data centre foray” and that “core growth remains modest.”It expects TCS’s revenue, EBIT, and PAT to grow 5.8%, 7.8%, and 7.5% year-on-year, respectively, in the second half of FY26. The brokerage added that clarity on “capital structure, capex schedule, rentals, and MOU for the data centre” would be key to evaluating the initiative’s long-term value.NuvamaNuvama Institutional Equities reiterated its 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 3,650, implying a potential upside of nearly 19%. The brokerage described TCS’s Q2 as a “decent quarter,” noting that the plan to set up a 1 GW AI data centre marks a “strategic move” aligned with evolving enterprise demand.However, it trimmed its FY26 and FY27 earnings per share estimates by around 2% each, citing lower growth assumptions. “Near-term volatility is expected,” the brokerage said, but it maintained that “the long-term outlook remains strong.”Also read | TCS Q2 results: Top 10 takeaways from September quarter earnings(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "title": "Relief for Vodafone Idea could indirectly benefit Airtel and Indus Towers: Mayuresh Joshi",
    "content": "In a strong quarterly showing, Bharti Airtel has reported impressive numbers across the board, signalling continued operational strength both in India and Africa.Speaking to ET Now, Mayuresh Joshi, Head Equity, Marketsmith India lauded the telecom major’s performance, calling it “a great set of numbers that Bharti Airtel has reported on all accounts.” He highlighted that revenue growth has been “very decent,” with India mobile revenue jumping 13% year-on-year, supported by higher realizations and an expanding customer base.“The margins were very good. In fact, the India margins came at 60%. The overall margins came at 57.4 which was higher than consensus. Net debt to EBITDA on an annualized basis is now at 1.63 times, far lesser than last year’s 2.5 times,” Joshi noted. He added that ARPU came in at Rs 256, in line with expectations, while customer additions “have been very decent in the quarter gone by.”Joshi also pointed out that beyond mobile services, Airtel’s home broadband segment witnessed “very significant growth,” further strengthening the company’s performance. “These numbers are super in this environment and therefore great set of numbers,” he summed up.On Airtel’s announcement of its intention to acquire an additional 5% stake in Indus Towers, Joshi viewed the move as a strategic step. “They are heading on to the digital infrastructure. In the last one year they have added more than 12,500 new towers and rolled out more than 44,000 km of fibre,” he said. “It is a consolidation both in terms of the digital infrastructure capabilities that they probably want to add. It gives them the boost from the Indus Tower acquisition — a step in the right direction to boost their overall digital infrastructure.”Discussing the recent Supreme Court order and its potential implications for the telecom sector, Joshi said some relief for Vodafone Idea regarding AGR dues could also benefit others. “If there is some element of relief for Vodafone, some incremental relief can also be expected for Airtel. To a certain extent if that probably happens, Indus also gets its fair share of relief being directly or indirectly associated with that. So, it all depends on the central government stance now,” he remarked.On Airtel Africa’s performance, Joshi said the business has also delivered strongly. “The kind of numbers that the Africa business has reported have been very decent. The customer base stands around 17.5 crore, and as they increase their digital footprint in Africa, there will be more efficiencies that can also kick in from the African business,” he observed.With strong domestic performance, improving leverage metrics, and a focused push toward digital infrastructure expansion, Bharti Airtel appears well-positioned for sustained growth both in India and international markets.",

Total income, however, was impacted by a 32.2% decline in other income, which dropped to Rs 12 crore from Rs 18 crore a year ago.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at Rs 268 crore, marking a YoY growth of 33.1% from Rs 201 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Profit before tax (PBT) grew 37% YoY to Rs 251 crore versus Rs 183 crore in the year-ago period.Sequentially, the company registered a 5.9% increase in sales from Rs 1,196 crore in the April-June 2025 quarter. PAT rose 7.7% from Rs 178 crore in the prior quarter, while EBITDA was up 4.5% sequentially.3M India stated that all its business segments, Transportation \u0026 Electronics, Safety and Industrial, Health Care, and Consumer, reported sales growth on a YoY basis. For the first half ended September 30, 2025, the company recorded a sales growth of 14.1%.“The company delivered 14.0% sales growth in the second quarter of the current financial year versus Q2 prior year. The company delivered broad-based growth across all four business segments. For the quarter, Healthcare sales grew 14.9%, Consumer 14.6%, Transportation \u0026 Electronics 12.9% and Safety \u0026 Industrial 12.3% versus the prior year. We are encouraged by the sales growth in Q2 as well as the first half of FY 25-26, despite a timing benefit in the quarter due to certain project-related businesses. The company’s profit after tax grew 43.0% to Rs 191 crore in Q2 FY26. The company maintained higher spending levels during the quarter in sales and marketing to improve market penetration. I thank our teams for their focus on customers and disciplined execution during the quarter,“ said Ramesh Ramadurai, Managing Director of 3M India.After an impressive Q2FY26 performance, analysts at ICICI Securities believe the quarter may mark a key inflexion point, as cyclical tailwinds in the auto sector, GST-related benefits, and increased government-led infrastructure spending are likely to support sustained growth in the second half of FY26.The favourable base from H2FY25 is also expected to support momentum. As a result, earnings estimates for FY26 and FY27 have been raised by 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively.Also read: NSE to launch pre-open session for F\u0026O segment starting December 8.

    "title": "GST rate rationalisation delivers gains, not losses: SBI Research busts forecasts of revenue hit",
    "content": "The widespread fears of a major GST revenue collapse following the September 22 rate rationalisation have been roundly refuted by the latest GST collections data and a detailed analysis from SBI Research.\n\nIn a strongly worded report titled “THE LOSS THAT NEVER WAS!”, the bank’s research team states that the “mind-boggling figures of revenue losses being touted post GST rationalization have been trumped by today’s GST data release for October,” adding that evidence “suggests that rationalization does not necessarily weaken revenue collections… Instead, the evidence points to a temporary adjustment phase followed by stronger inflows as happened in 2018 and 2019.”\n\nThe latest gross GST collections for October 2025 — which reflect returns filed for September, including nine post-rationalisation days — rose 4.6% year-on-year to ₹1.96 lakh crore, effectively defying predictions of a steep downward shock.\n\nNotably, while domestic consumption-linked revenue grew 2% YoY, GST import revenue surged 12.8% YoY, signalling robust demand for goods and inputs. “Defying wild speculations of a great fall… Gross GST collections for Oct’25 increased by 4.6% to Rs 1.96 lakh crore,” the report notes in its executive summary.\n\nRecord high e-way bills underscore demand strength\n\nOne of the clearest indicators of sustained economic momentum is the record 13.2 crore e-way bills generated in September 2025 — the highest since GST rollout. SBI Research writes that this growth is “an insignia of enhanced ease of business processes,” contributing to “total refund for Oct 25…registering a YoY growth of 39.6%.”\n\nPredicted state losses fail to materialise — many actually gained\n\nMultiple research houses and policy commentators had forecast deep state-level losses post rationalisation, estimating annual losses up to ₹10 lakh crore.\n\nA slide in the report lists the estimated short-term revenue loss projections:\n\nAgency Estimated Loss (₹ crore)\n\nDFC First Bank Research -  1,80,000\nAxis Bank Research - 1,80,000\nSBI Research - 60,000\nSurjit Bhalla \u0026 Rajesh Shukla (Independent Estimates) - 10,00,000\nFinance Ministry, GoI - 48,000\nEmkay Global Research - 1,20,000\n\nSBI says these fears were overblown\n\n“Interestingly, the strong momentum of GST collections belies not only the near absurd fear of large falls being circulated, it refutes the apprehension expressed by states about a perceived decline in GST revenue post rationalization,” SBI writes.\n\nMany states that were projected to lose revenue actually saw gains:\n\nState Estimated Monthly Loss (₹ cr) pre-rationalisation Actual Oct gain/loss %\n\nKarnataka –7,083 +10%\nPunjab –750 +4%\nTelangana –3,683 +10%\nWest Bengal –1,667 –1% (marginal)\nKerala –2,083 –2%\n\n“However, the estimated declines have not materialized as Karnataka actually gained 10% in Oct-25 compared to Oct-24. Similarly, Punjab has gained around 4%, while Telangana gained 10%.”\n\nThe decline seen in West Bengal and Kerala is described as marginal and temporary.\n\nState-wise performance: The big picture\n\nAccording to GSTN data summarised in the report:\n\nTop growth-performing states (Oct-25 YoY %):\n\nAssam: +34%\n\nNagaland: +46%\n\nArunachal Pradesh: +44%\n\nBihar: +11%\n\nJharkhand: +14%\n\nLarge states showing robust demand:\n\nMaharashtra: ₹30,630 cr → ₹31,092 cr (+2%)\n\nKarnataka: strong rebound and unexpected gain\n\nGujarat: steady collections at ₹11,407 cr → ₹12,153 cr (+7%)\n\nStates with moderate decline:\n\nTamil Nadu: –2%\n\nRajasthan: –3%\n\nKerala: –2%\n\nA notable gap remains in Delhi, which saw –5% YoY, attributed by analysts to a structural shift in consumption and compliance tightening.\n\nWhy loss estimates were so wrong\n\nSBI points to three fundamental blind spots in earlier projections:\n\n1. Underestimation of GST buoyancy\n\nHistorical data has shown that after rate cuts, compliance improves and collections strengthen.\n\n“Evidence from earlier rounds of GST rate changes… indicates that rationalisation should be seen less as a short-lived stimulus to demand and more as a structural measure that… widens the tax base.”\n\n2. Focus on headline rate changes, ignoring input credit chain efficiency\n\nRationalisation simplifies classification, reduces disputes, and stabilises tax planning.\n\n3. Better systemic compliance enforcement\n\nRecord e-way bills, AI-assisted fraud detection and higher voluntary compliance are raising the effective tax yield.\n\nNet revenue efficiency improves substantially\n\nDespite a sharp increase in refunds — ₹26,934 crore in October, up 39.6% YoY — net revenue still stood at ₹1.69 lakh crore.\n\nSBI writes: “Total refund increased from Rs 1.3 lakh crore in FY21 to Rs 2.5 lakh crore in FY25,” yet overall revenues remain buoyant and rising.\n\nThe implication:\nCompliance is stronger and leakage is lower than feared.\n\nA turning point for GST reform\n\nThe report argues that policymakers should feel encouraged to continue rate simplification.\n\n“Rationalisation should be seen as a step towards long-term revenue buoyancy and greater efficiency in the economy.”\n\nThis is consistent with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statements that GST reforms must “feel different to the taxpayer” and significantly ease business operations.\n\nFY26 outlook: States to be net gainers\n\nOn a very rudimentary assumption that Oct-25 post-rationalisation patterns persist, SBI Research projects:\n\nState FY26 GST Revenue Growth Projection\n\nKarnataka +10.7%\nMaharashtra +6%\nGujarat +5.6%\nTamil Nadu +5.3%\nUttar Pradesh +4.0%\nBihar +7.1%\nTelangana +3.6%\n\n“Thus, overall states will remain net gainers post GST rationalization,” SBI concludes.\n\nIndustry \u0026 policy implications\n\nThis reversal of narrative has three crucial outcomes:\n \tStates have more fiscal comfort: the Centre may face fewer resistance points in future GST rate restructuring.\n \tBusiness confidence improves: predictability in taxation aids investment decisions.\n \tBetter argument for trimming the 28% bracket: a cleaner rate slab structure now looks more achievable.\n\nMarkets see signal of growth durability\n\nTax analysts say the data reinforces India’s domestic demand resilience. A GST buoyancy near 1.4x of GDP growth suggests tax reforms are strengthening, not weakening, the exchequer.\n\nA senior economist responding to the report commented that it “changes the tone of the revenue debate” around GST.\n\nThe big takeaway\n\nAfter years of political and administrative debate, GST rationalisation — often seen as a risky move — now appears to be fiscally favourable.\n\nSBI’s conclusion is unambiguous, “The loss that never was.”\n\nOr as a senior tax partners put it, “The reforms did not break GST; they made it work better.”\n\nThe SBI Research report provides the first grounded indication that India may finally be transitioning to the next generation of GST — one that grows with the economy, rewards compliance, and reduces structural inefficiencies.\n\nWith data proving earlier forecasts wrong, the big question shifts from “Will revenues fall?” to “How aggressively can we simplify next?”",

It has sought regularisation of pending tax cases, restoration of input tax credit benefits, and delinking of restaurant GST rates from hotel room tariffs to create a more balanced and transparent system. The industry body believes these measures would not only ease compliance and reduce litigation but also enhance the sector’s competitiveness and contribution to India’s growth story.The Federation of Hotel \u0026 Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) has urged the Union Finance Ministry to rationalise the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework for the hospitality sector, calling for regularisation of past GST dues, restoration of input tax credit (ITC) benefits, and delinking of food and beverage (F\u0026B) GST rates from hotel room tariffs.\n\nIn a representation submitted to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the industry body said the sector continues to face tax disputes arising from interpretational ambiguities since the introduction of GST in 2017. It requested the government to invoke Section 11A of the CGST Act, 2017, introduced through the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024, to regularise pending disputes.\n\nAccording to FHRAI, many demand notices issued to hotels were based on differing interpretations of “declared tariff” versus “transaction value,” and on inflated rates displayed by online travel agencies that included commissions. The association noted that such disputes were not cases of tax evasion but resulted from technical inconsistencies during the initial years of GST implementation.\n“The sector continues to be burdened with disputes arising from interpretational issues rather than non-compliance,” FHRAI said, urging the government to regularise all such cases on an “as-is” basis and issue clarifications for instances where services were not rendered or payments not received.\n\nSeeks restoration of ITC benefits\n\nFHRAI also raised concerns over the withdrawal of ITC benefits following the rate revision that reduced GST on hotel rooms priced below ₹7,500 from 12% to 5%. While acknowledging the move’s intent to make hospitality services more affordable, the association said the loss of ITC has increased operational costs for mid-scale hotels due to unrecoverable input taxes on rent, maintenance, and supplies.\n\nThe body has recommended restoration of ITC even at the 5% rate, recognition of hotel rooms as “plant and machinery” for credit eligibility, and revision of the current ₹7,500 tariff threshold to ₹12,500 in line with inflation and currency depreciation since 2017. It also called for transitional guidelines to ensure uniform compliance and avoid future disputes.\n\nDelinking F\u0026B GST from room tariffs\n\nThe association further sought to delink restaurant GST rates from hotel room tariffs, arguing that the current framework—where restaurants in hotels with room tariffs above ₹7,500 charge 18% GST with ITC and those below the threshold charge 5% without ITC—creates operational disparities and compliance challenges.\n\nFHRAI proposed allowing all hotel-based restaurants to choose between 18% GST with ITC or 5% without ITC, regardless of room tariff categories. It said that linking restaurant GST rates with accommodation pricing distorts market dynamics, discourages tariff flexibility, and limits revenue potential.\n\nA study conducted by the FHRAI Centre of Excellence for Research in Tourism \u0026 Hospitality (CERTH) found that relaxing the ₹7,500 threshold could allow mid-segment hotels to increase tariffs during high-demand periods, potentially raising annual GST collections by over ₹4,000 crore.\n\nIndustry perspective\n\n“The hospitality sector has always been a reliable partner in India’s economic growth, yet GST anomalies continue to create unnecessary strain,” said Surendra Kumar Jaiswal, President, FHRAI.\n\n“Regularising past dues, restoring ITC benefits, and delinking F\u0026B GST from room tariffs are essential steps to establish a fair and transparent tax system. These reforms will simplify compliance, generate higher revenues for the government, and strengthen the foundations of our industry.”\n\nFHRAI said the proposed reforms will help reduce litigation, restore business confidence, and align with the government’s ‘Viksit Bharat @ 2047’ vision. A simplified, consistent, and equitable GST framework, it added, would enhance India’s competitiveness as a global tourism destination and support sustainable growth in the country’s hospitality sector.",

    "title": "Why silver may hold its ground despite recent corrections, explains ICICI Prudential AMC",
    "content": "Silver’s recent correction may not derail its long-term outlook, according to ICICI Prudential AMC, which sees industrial demand and supply constraints supporting prices. The fund house expects the metal’s dual role as a precious and industrial asset to keep it resilient amid global uncertainty.Silver’s recent price correction may not signal a reversal in its long-term prospects, according to ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company (AMC). The fund house believes that the metal’s expanding industrial applications and continued role as an inflation hedge are likely to support its value over time.\n\nChintan Haria, Principal – Investment Strategy at ICICI Prudential AMC, said silver’s dual nature as both a precious and industrial metal gives it unique staying power in a volatile commodities market.\n\n“Silver has the twin advantage of being an inflation hedge and also an industrial metal linked to economic growth,” he said.\nICICI Prudential AMC was among the first to launch a Silver Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in India in early 2022, identifying the growing relevance of the metal as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nHaria noted that silver has delivered about 30% compounded annual growth over the past three years, reflecting the combined influence of industrial use and investment demand.\n\nIndustrial demand remains a key pillar\n\nSilver’s importance has expanded well beyond its ornamental and traditional uses. Haria pointed out that emerging sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, 5G telecommunications, biopharma, and medical technology have become major consumers.\n\nThe metal is also widely used in solar panels, mirrors, automobiles, industrial batteries, and manufacturing processes.\n\nThe demand-supply gap has been a crucial factor in maintaining price stability.\n\n“Given the demand-supply mismatch of recent years, price resilience may continue,” Haria said. Silver has outperformed inflation in four of the past six years, and this trend may extend through 2025, supported by both industrial demand and investor interest.\n\nTemporary correction seen as part of healthy cycle\n\nICICI Prudential AMC recently reopened investments in its Silver ETF Fund of Fund (FoF) after a brief suspension earlier this year. The temporary halt, according to Haria, was prompted by a sharp rise in ETF prices caused by a shortage of physical silver in the market.\n\n“The decision was taken to protect investors from potential overvaluation,” he explained.\n\nFollowing a nearly 20% correction last week and the easing of supply tightness, the fund has been reopened for subscription. Haria described the roughly 15% decline in silver prices since mid-October as “a reasonable correction” after a steep rally, suggesting that the market is returning to equilibrium.\n\nLong-term outlook supported by global factors\n\nData from the Silver Institute indicates that global demand exceeded supply in 2024 and is expected to do so again in 2025. Haria believes this sustained deficit, along with broader industrial use, underpins a constructive long-term outlook for silver.\n\nHe pointed to the gold-to-silver ratio as a key valuation measure. The ratio rose from around 70 in 2020–21 to 104 in April 2025, implying silver was deeply undervalued compared to gold. It now stands near 83, which Haria considers a more reasonable level.\n\nMacroeconomic trends could also offer support. “Further interest rate cuts in the United States and progress on trade relations involving major economies such as the US, China, and India are positive signals,” Haria said.\n\nMeasured exposure recommended\n\nFor retail investors, Haria suggested gaining exposure through Silver ETFs or FoFs, depending on whether they hold a demat account. He said that systematic investment plans (SIPs) can help average out volatility, while lumpsum investments may be considered during price dips.\n\nWhile allocation levels depend on individual portfolios and risk tolerance, Haria advised that a 5–10% exposure to silver could be appropriate. “Asset allocation should remain the guiding principle for all investment decisions,” he said.",

In his latest update, he detailed tweaks to his portfolio, favouring companies delivering solid performance and consistent execution.\n\nOrton said he's trimmed on his position in ICICI Bank after a period of relative weakness and shifted some part of that capital into HDFC Bank, a stock that he's he has held for a while, which he stated is 'working better.'\n\nHe has also added Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, which he bought after meeting the company's management in India last June. Orton said he's confident about the business, and he likes the execution the way the management team is executing and working to capture a bigger share of clients' spending.\n\n\nOrton is now closely watching Mahindra and Mahindra (M\u0026M) ahead of its results this week. He described it as a 'high-quality name' that provides exposure to a 'premium asset with a growing middle-class consumer in India.' He indicated that if the company reports strong results without a correspondingly robust market reaction, he would look to add to his existing overweight position.\n\nAlso Read:Gold could hit $4500 by end-2025, average $5000 in 2026: CPM Group’s Jeffrey Christian\n\nOn the global front, Orton believes the 'risk-on' environment is likely to continue. He pointed to strong earnings from US technology hyperscalers as a key positive. According to him, the most important takeaway from the US earnings season is the confirmation that capital expenditures will continue, which underpins the artificial intelligence (AI) investment theme. 'I think it supports this notion that AI isn't a bubble… it provides a lot of strong momentum, I think for risk-on to continue,' Orton said.\n\n\n\nRegarding US-China relations, Orton opined that market expectations for a breakthrough during the recent talks between leaders were too high. He views the outcome—which saw a reduction in the effective tariff rate and a move to 'kick the can further down the road'—as a net positive. It provides clarity and reduces the risk of an 'economic calamity or significant shock,' which is sufficient for markets for now.\n\nAlso Read: Canara Bank gears up for next phase of growth with strong retail \u0026 MSME push: CEO KS Raju\n\nFor the entire interview, watch the accompanying video\n\nCatch all the latest updates from the stock market here",

Excluding the notebooks segment, FMCG revenue was up 8%.\nWhat's not\n\nThe agri business remained a drag, with revenue declining 31% year-on-year, due to seasonality and a high base. The company also saw pressure on value-added exports, which were hit by geopolitical uncertainty and US tariffs.\n\nWhat brokerages say\nJefferies has a 'Buy' rating on ITC with a price target of ₹535. The brokerage said cigarette volume growth remained strong, rising around 6% year-on-year, which is better than many FMCG peers. However, operating margins were under pressure due to higher tobacco costs and intense competition.\n\nGrowth in the FMCG segment picked up pace, though margins stayed weak. Overall, operating profit grew 2% during the quarter. The management expects business momentum to improve in the coming quarters.\n\nCiti also has a 'Buy' call on ITC with a price target of ₹500. The brokerage said second-quarter revenue fell 2%, dragged down by the agri business, but excluding that, revenue rose 8%. Both operating profit and net profit were up 2% year-on-year.\n\nThe brokerage noted investor concerns around slower growth compared to rivals and pressure on margins, but believes ITC's product mix and brand strategies will help protect its market share.\n\nNomura, which also has a 'Buy' rating with a price target of ₹540, said the company's results were broadly in line with expectations. It sees a recovery ahead in the paperboard segment, while the agri business faced a high base and the foodtech segment continues to expand.\n\nITC shares are currently trading at about 23 times their projected earnings two years ahead.\n\nOf the 39 analysts that have coverage on ITC, 37 of them have a 'Buy' rating, which one each has a 'Hold' and 'Sell' recommendation on the stock.\n\nShares of ITC Ltd. settled 0.53% lower on Thursday at ₹419.35, ahead of the earnings announcement. The stock is still down 13% so far this year.Note To ReadersDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on CNBCTV18.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

These comprise office premises, residential units, and land parcels.\n\nIn response to the development, the company stated, \"There is no impact on the business operations, shareholders, employees or any other stakeholders of Reliance Infrastructure Limited.\"\nThe statement further clarified that Anil D. Ambani has not been associated with the board of Reliance Infrastructure Limited for over three and a half years.\nAccording to sources, the orders were issued on October 31, 2025, under Section 5(1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which allows the ED to temporarily attach properties suspected to be linked to proceeds of crime to prevent their transfer during investigation.\n\nThe ED has alleged that the case involves diversion and laundering of public funds raised by Reliance Home Finance Ltd. (RHFL) and Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd. (RCFL). They claim that between 2017 and 2019, Yes Bank invested ₹2,965 crore in RHFL instruments and ₹2,045 crore in RCFL instruments, which later turned into non-performing investments.\n\nAccording to the ED, its probe found that investments by the erstwhile Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund into Anil Ambani Group financial companies were routed indirectly through Yes Bank exposures, allegedly in violation of SEBI’s mutual fund conflict of interest guidelines, claimed sources.\n\nThe funds were ultimately traced to Reliance group-linked entities, the agency has claimed, said sources.\n\nSources added that the ED has further alleged that RHFL and RCFL extended loans to connected companies, with serious control lapses and procedural violations. \"Loans were allegedly processed and disbursed without due diligence, with incomplete or undated documents, weak borrower financials, and inadequate security creation,\" shared sources.\n\nThe sources said that, in a related investigation, the ED has also intensified its probe into the Reliance Communications Ltd.

    "content": "HomeBusiness NewsSBI Chair CS Setty optimistic on banking sector’s asset quality and credit growthState Bank of India Chairperson CS Setty discusses banking sector stability, asset quality, and credit growth at the India Business Leader Awards 2025.State Bank of India (SBI) Chairperson CS Setty expressed strong confidence in the banking sector’s stability and growth trajectory, noting that Indian banks are currently witnessing one of the most stable phases in terms of asset quality.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC-TV18 at the India Business Leader Awards (IBLA) 2025 jury round, Setty said, “As far as banking is concerned, I think we are going through one of the most benign asset quality life cycles in the financial services. And I'm sure with a lot of improvement in underwriting and the way we are looking at and the data availability, the asset quality cycle will continue for some more time.”\n\nHe added that bank balance sheets are robust and profitability has improved significantly, supported by prudent lending practices and better data-driven credit assessment.\nOn the subject of credit growth, Setty clarified that it would be inaccurate to say lending momentum has slowed. “Some sectors are doing extremely well, obviously. And when we talk about corporate credit, it is waiting for sustained consumer demand in the country. We see a visible uptick on the consumption side, and if it is sustained, I’m sure the corporates will come back to private capital expenditure,” he told CNBC-TV18 at the India Business Leader Awards (IBLA) 2025.\n\n'Consolidation among PSBs likely to continue'SBI Chairman said that further consolidation among public sector banks is likely in the coming years, driven by the need for scale and efficiency.\n“There were 26 public sector banks, now reduced to 12. Some of the scale benefits from this consolidation are already visible,” he noted.\n“We must remember that scale is crucial — without it, investments in technology are impaired, and the returns on such investments become difficult to realise. From that angle, there will definitely be some consolidation going forward, though the timeline is uncertain,” he added.\nAlso Read: IBLA 2025 | 'Understand what makes consumers tick': KM Birla on winning in the consumer marketFirst Published: Oct 31, 2025 7:58 PM IST",

    "content": "HomeMarket NewsStocks NewsReliance-Google join hands to build India’s AI infrastructure and broaden accessReliance and Google announce a wide-ranging AI partnership spanning consumers, enterprises, and compute—aiming to make artificial intelligence more accessible and build India’s digital AI backbone.India's most valuable company, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)  and Google on Thursday (October 30) have announced a broad strategic partnership to expand access to artificial intelligence (AI) in India and create local compute capacity for the country’s growing digital ecosystem.\n\nThe collaboration goes beyond a commercial product tie-up, extending from consumer and enterprise applications to the underlying infrastructure required to train and deploy AI models. Both companies describe it as a long-term initiative aligned with India’s “AI for All” vision.\n\nAI for the masses\nA key part of the initiative is a mass-scale AI inclusion drive—Jio users aged 18-25 will receive 18 months of free access to Google Gemini Pro, a plan worth ₹35,100 per user. This follows Reliance’s earlier attempts to broaden access to digital technology through affordable data and smartphones.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Industries delivers robust Q2 performance led by strong growth in consumer businesses\n\n\n\nThe companies say the aim is to make advanced AI tools available to all, not just premium or enterprise users. Joint development is also planned for localised language and voice models that can handle India’s linguistic diversity.\n\nEnterprise and Cloud integration\n\nFor businesses, the partnership will bring the Gemini Enterprise suite to India, along with ready-to-deploy AI agents built for local use cases in sectors like retail, finance, and manufacturing. Reliance Cloud and Google Cloud are expected to offer an integrated AI stack designed to make enterprise adoption easier and faster.\n\nThe companies claim this could help smaller firms access generative AI tools without large upfront investments in talent or infrastructure.\n\nBuilding compute capacity in India\n\nA major part of the plan involves creating India-based compute infrastructure using Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)—specialised chips used to train AI models. The infrastructure, to be powered partly by Reliance’s green energy assets, aims to provide domestic capacity for AI training and inference, reducing reliance on overseas data centres.\n\nExecutives say this setup will support startups, research institutions, and enterprises working on AI, while also aligning with India’s ambition to develop sovereign, energy-efficient data capabilities.\n\nBroader economic impact\n\nIf executed as outlined, the partnership could have a broad impact—from giving consumers early exposure to AI tools, to lowering barriers for startups, to enabling workforce training in AI-assisted productivity.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Retail Q2 Results: Revenue rises 19% YoY to ₹90,544 crore, EBITDA beats estimates\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the collaboration reflects a growing trend of public-private alignment around AI infrastructure and access—areas increasingly seen as central to national competitiveness.\n\nThis is less about a new product and more about laying the groundwork for India’s AI economy—combining Google’s technical depth with Reliance’s national reach.Note To ReadersDisclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd, which owns Jio, is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust that controls Network18, the parent company of CNBCTV18.com.First Published: Oct 30, 2025 6:33 PM IST",

Revenue stood at ₹18,021 crore, reflecting a 3.4% decline from ₹18,648 crore in Q2 of the previous year.\n\nEBITDA increased 2.1% year-on-year to ₹6,252 crore from ₹6,123 crore, with the EBITDA margin expanding to 34.7% from 32.8% in the corresponding period last year.\n\nWhen compared with CNBC-TV18 polls, the company’s net profit of ₹5,180 crore beat the estimated ₹5,062 crore, while revenue of ₹18,021 crore fell short of the poll estimate of ₹19,220 crore. Earnings Per Share for the quarter were ₹4.13, compared with ₹3.98 in the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ITC Hotels Q2 Results: Net profit jumps 74% to ₹133 crore; margin expands from last year\n\n\n\nEBITDA came in slightly below the poll estimate at ₹6,252 crore versus ₹6,290 crore, and the margin exceeded expectations at 34.7% versus 32.7% forecasted. The company reported gross revenue of ₹19,148 crore for the second quarter, up 7.1% year-on-year (ex-Agri Business), driven by Cigarettes and FMCG.\n\nConsolidated Performance:\n\nThe company’s consolidated performance was supported by strong operating results from group companies, including ITC Infotech India Limited and ITC Hotels Limited. Its subsidiary, Surya Nepal Private Limited, delivered a resilient performance despite disruptions in Nepal during September 2025. Gross revenue (ex-Agri Business) increased 7.9% YoY, with EBITDA up 2.2% YoY.\n\nFMCG – Others\n\nThe FMCG – Others segment sustained its revenue growth momentum amidst operational challenges, up 8% YoY (ex-Notebooks). Excessive rains in several parts of the country and the transition to the new GST regime caused short-term business disruptions. Staples, Dairy, Premium Personal Wash, and Agarbattis drove growth.\n\nStrong performance continued in the premium portfolio and NewGen channels. The Notebooks industry remained impacted due to low-priced paper imports and opportunistic plays by local and regional players. Segment EBITDA margin improved 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ITC Hotels opens 98-key Welcomhotel in Bodh Gaya\n\n\n\nCommodity prices stabilised at elevated levels, and segment EBITDA margins stood at 10% (Q2FY25: 10.6%; Q1FY2:6 9.4%). Smart net revenue management, ongoing price-volume-value rebalancing, and focused cost management initiatives helped mitigate input price volatility.\n\nCompetitive trade and marketing investments continued to support growth and market standing. The digital-first and organic portfolio performed robustly, with ARR1 approximately ₹1,100 crore.\n\nFMCG – Cigarettes\n\nThe Cigarettes segment recorded net revenue growth of 6.8% YoY, with segment PBIT up 4.3% YoY. Differentiated variants and the premium segment registered strong growth, leveraging mainstream trademarks and innovation. Strategic portfolio and market interventions, including a focus on competitive belts and measures to counter illicit trade, reinforced market standing. Leaf tobacco consumption costs remained elevated, though moderation in procurement prices was observed in the current crop cycle.\n\nAgri Business\n\nThe Agri Business segment’s performance reflected timing differences and a high base effect. H1 segment revenue grew 7%, while H1 segment results increased 10%. Leaf tobacco posted strong growth, with the business leveraging crop development expertise, superior product quality, and strong customer relationships.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ITC shares are a 'buy' for 92% analysts who track the stock; Check their price targets\n\n\n\nValue-added Agri exports were relatively subdued due to delayed call-offs amid uncertainty regarding US tariffs. The company continued to focus on market development in new geographies and scaling up the business by leveraging structural capabilities in sourcing and processing.\n\nPaperboards, Paper \u0026 Packaging\n\nThe Paper segment’s performance improved sequentially, with profit up 17% and margins up 90 basis points quarter-on-quarter. The operating environment remained challenging due to low-priced supplies in global markets, elevated domestic wood prices, and subdued realisations. Initial signs of moderation in wood prices and improved availability were observed. Segment revenue grew 5% YoY, driven by volumes, and the speciality paper segment posted robust growth.\n\n\n\nShares of ITC Ltd ended at ₹418.70, down by ₹2.90, or 0.69%, on the BSE.First Published: Oct 30, 2025 5:12 PM IST",

(formerly known as Adani Wilmar Ltd.)\n  “Consumer demand remained below expectations through the fiscal year, leading to lower-thanplanned volume growth. Nevertheless, the Company demonstrated agility in navigating external challenges, delivering a 7% sequential increase in sales volumes in Q2 over Q1. The Company recorded revenue of INR 17,605 crores, growing by 22% YoY, with an underlying volume growth of 2% YoY. Realization in edible oils business was higher due to YoY increase in the commodity prices, which also led to the softening of consumer demand in edible oils. We continued to deliver healthy profits on LTM basis in Sep ’25 recording an operating EBITDA of INR 2,328 crores and PAT of INR 1,084 crores. Our focus on improving the profitability in the Food \u0026 FMCG segment has led to highest-ever PBT of 132 crores in H1, with PBT margin of 4.3%. In the rice business, we delivered a strong turnaround in this financial year, achieving 30%+ volume growth in our branded Basmati business in both Q1 and Q2, along with improved overall profitability in the rice portfolio. Quick commerce sales maintained strong momentum, delivering 86% YoY volume growth in Q2 and overall revenue from alternate channels (MT + Ecom) surpassed INR 4,400 crores over the last twelve months. According to internal estimates, our market share in e-commerce (including quick commerce) stands at ~50% in Soya oil, ~40% in Mustard oil, ~30% in besan (gram flour), ~25% in Sunflower oil and in the low teens for wheat flour - reflecting strong consumer preference for the ‘Fortune’ brand. Food \u0026 FMCG volumes have already surpassed edible oils in alternate channels, and we aim to drive deeper penetration in general trade to achieve double-digit volume growth for the segment.” - Angshu Mallick, MD \u0026 CEO, AWL Agri Business Ltd.

Total income, however, was impacted by a 32.2% decline in other income, which dropped to Rs 12 crore from Rs 18 crore a year ago.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at Rs 268 crore, marking a YoY growth of 33.1% from Rs 201 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Profit before tax (PBT) grew 37% YoY to Rs 251 crore versus Rs 183 crore in the year-ago period.Sequentially, the company registered a 5.9% increase in sales from Rs 1,196 crore in the April-June 2025 quarter. PAT rose 7.7% from Rs 178 crore in the prior quarter, while EBITDA was up 4.5% sequentially.3M India stated that all its business segments, Transportation \u0026 Electronics, Safety and Industrial, Health Care, and Consumer, reported sales growth on a YoY basis. For the first half ended September 30, 2025, the company recorded a sales growth of 14.1%.“The company delivered 14.0% sales growth in the second quarter of the current financial year versus Q2 prior year. The company delivered broad-based growth across all four business segments. For the quarter, Healthcare sales grew 14.9%, Consumer 14.6%, Transportation \u0026 Electronics 12.9% and Safety \u0026 Industrial 12.3% versus the prior year. We are encouraged by the sales growth in Q2 as well as the first half of FY 25-26, despite a timing benefit in the quarter due to certain project-related businesses. The company’s profit after tax grew 43.0% to Rs 191 crore in Q2 FY26. The company maintained higher spending levels during the quarter in sales and marketing to improve market penetration. I thank our teams for their focus on customers and disciplined execution during the quarter,“ said Ramesh Ramadurai, Managing Director of 3M India.After an impressive Q2FY26 performance, analysts at ICICI Securities believe the quarter may mark a key inflexion point, as cyclical tailwinds in the auto sector, GST-related benefits, and increased government-led infrastructure spending are likely to support sustained growth in the second half of FY26.The favourable base from H2FY25 is also expected to support momentum. As a result, earnings estimates for FY26 and FY27 have been raised by 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively.Also read: NSE to launch pre-open session for F\u0026O segment starting December 8.

The company clarified that the stake purchase could be executed in one or more tranches.“Given its strategic importance, it is prudent for Bharti Airtel to continually assess opportunities to consolidate its holding in Indus Towers, while balancing cash flow requirements for business capex and dividend payouts,” Bharti Airtel said in a regulatory filing on November 3.It added that any such acquisition, if undertaken, would depend on prevailing market conditions, including liquidity and price, and would comply with all applicable laws. As of the end of the September quarter, Bharti Airtel held a 51.03% stake in Indus Towers.On Monday, shares of Indus Towers jumped more than 5% after the Supreme Court clarified on Vodafone Idea’s AGR dues plea, saying the government is free to consider relief not only on additional dues but on the overall amount as well. Analysts see any such relief for Vodafone Idea as a key positive for Indus Towers, as it could pave the way for the company to resume dividend payouts to shareholders.Airtel shares will also be in focus after the telecom major reported a sharp 89% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its consolidated net profit for the second quarter of FY26.

VNB is a key performance metric, indicating expected future profits from the new insurance policies and long-term growth potential of the company’s new business. The overall performance may reflect the impact of regulatory changes, a high base, and evolving product mix — with a continued shift toward non-participating (non-par) and higher-margin products.The estimates by Kotak Institutional Equities and Emkay Research have also been taken into account. Here’s what brokerages forecast:1. Annualised Premium Equivalent (APE)Most brokerages expect LIC’s APE to decline slightly on a yearly basis due to muted momentum in new business and a high base effect.– Kotak Equities estimates APE at Rs 16,380 crore, down 0.5% YoY but up 29% QoQ.– Emkay Research expects 4.6% YoY fall to Rs 15,710 crore– YES Securities projects Rs 14,840 crore, a sharper 10% YoY fall and up 17% QoQ.– Centrum Broking: Rs 16,213 crore, down 1.5% YoY and up 28% QOQKotak said that LIC's YoY decline in APE is similar to the run-rate in the first two months of the quarter.\"We pencil in new business growth assumptions based on trends observed till August 2025, when LIC had displayed NBP/APE growth of 21%/35% for 2M2QFY26 (July and August 2025) over 2M1QFY26 (April and May 2025),\" YES said in a preview note.Emkay attributes strong growth in retail APE in the September quarter of FY25 to YoY decline in Q2FY25. The base effect is into play owing to the channel-push prior to the implementation of the new surrender regulations, the brokerage noted.2. Value of New Business (VNB)– Kotak Equities: Rs 2,844 crore, down 3.3% YoY and up 46% QoQ– YES Securities: Rs 2,374 crore, down 19% and up 22% QoQ– Centrum Broking – Rs 3,018 crore, up 3% YoY and up 55% QoQ– Emkay Research: Rs 2,821 crore, down 4.1% YoYVNB performance is expected to remain stable, aided by improved product mix and cost management.3. VNB margin– Kotak Equities forecasts a 17.4% margin, down 50 bps YoY and up 199 bps QoQ– Centrum Broking: 18.6%, up 82 bps YoY and up 325 bps QoQ– Emkay Research pegs it at 18%, up 10 bps YoY– Yes Securities expects a QoQ expansion of 63 bps, aided by mix improvement.4. New Business Premium (NBP)According to Yes Securities, NBP is expected to come in at Rs 58,677 crore, up 1% YoY but marginally lower 1% QoQ, reflecting steady momentum after a robust start to FY26.5. Assets Under Management Emkay Research projects LIC’s AUM at Rs 58.93 lakh crore, up 6.4% YoY, supported by stable inflows and positive market movements during the quarter.6. Profit After Tax (PAT)Emkay is the only brokerage among its peers to have given net profit estimates at Rs 8,198 crore, up 7.6% YoY, with continued benefits from steady operational performance.7. Key monitorablesInvestors should keep a track of LIC’s commentary on non-par product expansion and business mix shift, impact of GST ITC disallowance on margins and profitability and growth in group and retail APE segments.Trends in embedded value (EV) and management guidance for H2FY26, also remain key attributes to watch out for.(Disclaimer: The recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

(RIL) and Larsen \u0026 Toubro (L\u0026T), in its model portfolio, in its latest note on Wednesday, November 5.\n\nThe weightage on Reliance Industries has been increased by 100 basis points to 9.9%, while that on L\u0026T has been increased by 70 basis points to 2.7%, the Kotak note, authored by Sanjeev Prasad, stated.\n\nOn the flip side, the brokerage has removed Hindalco, which had a weightage of 170 basis points from the Model Portfolio. That weightage has been used to increase positions in Reliance Industries and L\u0026T.\nKotak Institutional Equities expects strong performance across all three major segments of Reliance over the next few quarters led by strong global refining margins due to possible disruption of global diesel supply, continued strong performance of the digital and telecom segment and a potential tariff increase over the next few weeks, and a robust performance of its retail business aided by a long growth runway.\n\nThe brokerage has a price target of ₹1,600 on Reliance Industries, which implies a potential upside of another 9% from current levels.\n\nFor Larsen \u0026 Toubro, robust order backlog in the core E\u0026C segment, large pipeline of new projects both in India and the Middle East, will contribute to the strong financial performance of the company, according to Kotak's note. The brokerage has a price target of ₹4,200 on L\u0026T, which implies a potential upside of 7% from current levels.\n\nThe brokerage has removed Hindalco from its model portfolio, given the fact that the stock has risen 9% in the last one month and 26% in the last three months. It sees meaningful downside for the stock from current levels, as its price target of ₹705, which implies a potential downside of 15% from current levels.\n\nKotak Institutional Equities wrote in its note that the current earnings season has shown subdued trends in mass consumption items but an uptick in select discretionary segments, modest IT services demand and moderate loan growth for banks. However, aggregate earnings are ahead of their estimates.",

The company ranks among the world’s top three telecom service providers by subscribers, with 624 million users across operations in 17 countries.\n\nThe agency noted that Bharti’s leverage, measured by adjusted debt-to-EBITDA, is expected to improve to 1.8x by FY2025–26 and further to 1.5x by FY2026–27, aided by earnings growth and debt reduction. The company prepaid ₹260 billion ($3 billion) in deferred spectrum liabilities during FY2024–25, accelerating its deleveraging.\n\nBharti’s consolidated revenue rose 17% year-on-year to ₹1.02 trillion, while EBITDA grew 20% to ₹580.9 billion in the first half of FY2025–26, driven primarily by its Indian operations, which account for 75–80% of total revenue and earnings.\n\nMoody’s said Bharti’s liquidity remains \"excellent,\" with ₹134 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September 30, sufficient to cover upcoming debt maturities, capital spending, and dividends over the next 18 months.\n\nAlso Read: Paytm Q2 Results | Net profit at ₹21 crore after one-time impairment; revenue surges 24%",

Both companies, considered bellwethers for India’s industrial and financial sectors, are witnessing early signs of a turnaround.After years of caution, India’s private sector is beginning to spend again. Capital expenditure (capex), which had long been led by government spending, is now seeing renewed momentum from private companies.\n\nIf recent commentary from Larsen \u0026 Toubro (L\u0026T) and the State Bank of India (SBI) is any indication, the country could be on the cusp of a revival in private sector investments. Both companies, considered bellwethers for India’s industrial and financial sectors, are witnessing early signs of a turnaround.\n\nFollowing its September quarter results, SBI management indicated that private sector capex activity is now broad-based across multiple industries. The bank reported a robust corporate credit pipeline of ₹7 lakh crore, comprising both underutilised working capital and term loans under disbursement.\n\"The new projects being discussed are spread across both the public and private sectors, but predominantly private. This pipeline is very strong — part of it will materialise this year, with some spillover into the next,\" said C.S. Setty, Managing Director, State Bank of India.\n\nReflecting this optimism, SBI raised its FY26 credit growth guidance to 12–14%, from 12–13% earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, Larsen \u0026 Toubro Ltd (L\u0026T), India’s largest engineering and infrastructure company, has already flashed the first signs of a private capex recovery. The company’s infrastructure projects segment received domestic orders worth ₹27,400 crore in the September quarter — nearly 50% higher year-on-year. Domestic order inflows for the business crossed the ₹20,000 crore mark for the first time in five fiscal quarters.\n\nAccording to Parameswaran Ramakrishnan, Vice President of Corporate Accounts and Investor Relations at L\u0026T, private sector capital expenditure is being driven by increased investments in manufacturing, renewables, real estate, digital infrastructure, and power generation, even as public infrastructure spending continues steadily.\n\nL\u0026T now expects to exceed its earlier order inflow guidance of 10% for FY26, and has projected revenue growth of 15% for the year.\n\nData compiled by CNBC-TV18 from Bloomberg shows that private capital expenditure in India grew just 8.4% in FY25, reaching ₹5.1 lakh crore — the slowest pace in four years. Around 210 non-financial BSE500 companies (excluding PSUs) spent ₹4.7 lakh crore on capex in FY24, marking a 23% increase that year.\n\nDespite the moderation, economists remain optimistic about India’s near-term growth prospects. The country’s GDP growth for FY26 is projected between 6.5% and 7%, supported by resilient consumption, a strong services sector, and steady investment momentum.\n\nAlso Read: Dalmia Bharat Sugar Q2 Results | Net profit dives 56% to ₹23 crore despite 7% revenue growthFirst Published: Nov 4, 2025 9:02 PM IST",

It contended that the Independent TV had failed to pay rental charges for the premises for the last five years and demanded reimbursement of rental charges along with electricity charges before extending further support and also restricted inspection.\n\nMeanwhile, Shree Sai Baba Ship Breaking Company emerged as the Successful Auction Purchaser (SAP) for assets of Independent TV, following which a sale certificate and possession memo comprising of 1,874 units of assets/inventory was handed over on December 10, 2024.\n\nLater, Reliance Realty approached NCLT during the ongoing CIRP for recovery of outstanding rental and other dues. However, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) directed Reliance Realty to allow the liquidator and SAP to access the leased premises to dismantle/remove the assets of the corporate debtor and not to cause any obstructions.\n\nThis was subsequently challenged by Reliance Realty before the appellate tribunal NCLAT. It contended that NCLT erroneously allowed the Liquidator to remove assets lying at the leased premises which also included the assets owned by Reliance Communication merely on the presumption that assets/goods lying at the premises during the CIRP is sufficient to establish ownership in favour of the Corporate Debtor.\n\nHowever, this was also rejected by NCLAT observing that NCLT, while passing the order, has not only taken into account the developments in the matter during CIRP and liquidation but also the site-visit reports of the liquidator and the fact that the goods/assets were in the possession and control of the Corporate Debtor.\n\nThe erstwhile Resolution Professional during the CIRP (corporate insolvency resolution) proceedings had already conducted a fair and transparent examination to ascertain the actual ownership of the assets lying in the leased premises while taking custody and control of the property of the Corporate Debtor.\n\n”This was not challenged by the RCom or the Appellant (Reliance Realty during the CIRP. Thereafter also when the Liquidator took control and possession of the goods/assets lying in the leased premises, this was also not objected to by the Appellant until completion of the auction process,” said NCLAT.\n\nMoreover, Reliance Realty was not a party to the SPA, through which the DTH business was transferred to Independent TV.\n\n”We are therefore persuaded to agree with the Respondent No 1 (Liquidator of Independent TV) that if any party should actually have been aggrieved by the impugned order, it should have been the RCom, which was the signatory to the SPA but is currently in liquidation. It has been submitted by the Respondent No.1 that though RCL is currently in liquidation, the Liquidator-Respondent No.1 has not received any intimation from the Liquidator of the RCL in this regard, claiming ownership of the assets lying in the leased premises,” NCLAT noted down in its order.",

    "content": "FILE PHOTO\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| Photo Credit:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeonhard Foeger\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t India now needs a comprehensive policy on gold to clearly define whether gold should be treated as a commodity or money, and how customers should perceive it, stated a report by State Bank of India (SBI). The report pointed out that perceptions of gold in the East and West are very different. It noted that in Western countries, gold has achieved the status of public property, while in the East, particularly in countries like India, Japan, Korea, and China gold continues to be viewed as private property.According to the report, \"The time has now come to conceive a comprehensive policy on gold and for such it is important that one defines what is gold (commodity or money) and how is gold perceived by its ultimate consumer.\" Currently, India's gold policy focuses mainly on reducing demand and recycling existing gold stocks for productive use.The report highlighted that since gold represents a source of funds without contributing directly to capital formation, monetising gold can have a positive impact on future investments. SBI also compared India's position on gold with that of China. The report showed that China's central bank holds around 2,300 tonnes of gold, while India's central bank holds about 880 tonnes. China has a stated central bank policy on gold, whereas India's is not specified. In terms of household gold holdings, Chinese households hold less than 10 grams on average, with a target of 20 grams, while Indian households hold over 25 grams. China has a defined household policy on gold linked to current account trends, but India's policy is need-based.China also has a clearly stated policy on gold, though it is not made public, while India has no formal statement. Commercial banks in China are involved in gold operations at various levels along the production and supply chain. In India, banks are largely restricted to financing the gems and jewellery sector, exporters, and gold deposits.In terms of production, China is the largest producer of gold in the world, with rapidly developing assaying facilities. India's domestic production is smaller, but reports from the Geological Survey of India (GSI) indicate large gold deposits in Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh. China also has a strong international presence as a member of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), while India, though not a member, is one of the largest exporters of gold jewellery in the world.As per report this happened because since independence, India's policies on gold have revolved around six main elements, encouraging people to invest in other asset classes, regulating gold supply, curbing smuggling, reducing household demand for physical gold, keeping domestic gold prices low, and ensuring exchange rate stability and financial balance.However, the report observed that most of these measures were short-term in nature and aimed primarily at reducing physical gold demand. Only three reports, the RBI's internal report in 1992 and two Tarapore Committee reports attempted to take a long-term view.The report added that the geopolitical importance of gold, which is now central to global economic discussions, was not given enough attention in earlier reports.It also pointed out that past policy interventions did not consider the views of the gold industry, which provides significant employment, both directly and indirectly.So the report outlined that it is time for India to take a comprehensive and long-term approach to gold policy that considers its economic, cultural, and strategic significance.Published on  November 5, 2025",

    "title": "LIC Q2 preview: APE may drop up to 10% YoY on high base, but margin stability offers comfort. 7 things to",
    "content": "Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) will announce its September quarter results on Thursday, where the country's largest life insurer is expected to report an up to 10% year-on-year drop in its Annual Premium Equivalent (APE) - a key sales metric. Its range is pegged at Rs 14,840 crore to Rs 16,380 crore according to estimates by four brokerages. Value of New Business (VNB) is seen in the range of Rs 2,374 crore and Rs 3,018 crore in the quarter under review. YES Securities remains most conservative in its estimates, suggesting a 19% YoY drop, while Centrum Broking sees it grow by 3% over the corresponding quarter of the last financial year. VNB is a key performance metric, indicating expected future profits from the new insurance policies and long-term growth potential of the company’s new business. The overall performance may reflect the impact of regulatory changes, a high base, and evolving product mix — with a continued shift toward non-participating (non-par) and higher-margin products.The estimates by Kotak Institutional Equities and Emkay Research have also been taken into account. Here’s what brokerages forecast:1. Annualised Premium Equivalent (APE)Most brokerages expect LIC’s APE to decline slightly on a yearly basis due to muted momentum in new business and a high base effect.– Kotak Equities estimates APE at Rs 16,380 crore, down 0.5% YoY but up 29% QoQ.– Emkay Research expects 4.6% YoY fall to Rs 15,710 crore– YES Securities projects Rs 14,840 crore, a sharper 10% YoY fall and up 17% QoQ.– Centrum Broking: Rs 16,213 crore, down 1.5% YoY and up 28% QOQKotak said that LIC's YoY decline in APE is similar to the run-rate in the first two months of the quarter.\"We pencil in new business growth assumptions based on trends observed till August 2025, when LIC had displayed NBP/APE growth of 21%/35% for 2M2QFY26 (July and August 2025) over 2M1QFY26 (April and May 2025),\" YES said in a preview note.Emkay attributes strong growth in retail APE in the September quarter of FY25 to YoY decline in Q2FY25. The base effect is into play owing to the channel-push prior to the implementation of the new surrender regulations, the brokerage noted.2. Value of New Business (VNB)– Kotak Equities: Rs 2,844 crore, down 3.3% YoY and up 46% QoQ– YES Securities: Rs 2,374 crore, down 19% and up 22% QoQ– Centrum Broking – Rs 3,018 crore, up 3% YoY and up 55% QoQ– Emkay Research: Rs 2,821 crore, down 4.1% YoYVNB performance is expected to remain stable, aided by improved product mix and cost management.3. VNB margin– Kotak Equities forecasts a 17.4% margin, down 50 bps YoY and up 199 bps QoQ– Centrum Broking: 18.6%, up 82 bps YoY and up 325 bps QoQ– Emkay Research pegs it at 18%, up 10 bps YoY– Yes Securities expects a QoQ expansion of 63 bps, aided by mix improvement.4. New Business Premium (NBP)According to Yes Securities, NBP is expected to come in at Rs 58,677 crore, up 1% YoY but marginally lower 1% QoQ, reflecting steady momentum after a robust start to FY26.5. Assets Under Management Emkay Research projects LIC’s AUM at Rs 58.93 lakh crore, up 6.4% YoY, supported by stable inflows and positive market movements during the quarter.6. Profit After Tax (PAT)Emkay is the only brokerage among its peers to have given net profit estimates at Rs 8,198 crore, up 7.6% YoY, with continued benefits from steady operational performance.7. Key monitorablesInvestors should keep a track of LIC’s commentary on non-par product expansion and business mix shift, impact of GST ITC disallowance on margins and profitability and growth in group and retail APE segments.Trends in embedded value (EV) and management guidance for H2FY26, also remain key attributes to watch out for.(Disclaimer: The recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "title": "SBI Q2 profit rises 10% on loan growth; and yes, it beats Street",
    "content": "State Bank of India (SBI)’s bottomline advanced 10% on year to Rs 20,160 crore in the second quarter, handsomely beating Street estimates of a marginal contraction, paced by growth in retail, agriculture and MSME (RAM) advances and profit from the sale of the lender’s Yes Bank stake.Net profit in the year-ago quarter was Rs 18,331 crore. A Bloomberg poll of analysts had expected profit to fall 4% year on year to Rs 17,523 crore.RAM advances rose 15% on year crossing Rs 25 lakh crore in the bank’s loan book led by a 19% growth in loans to small and medium advances and an identical 14% growth in retail and agriculture advances.Chairman CS Setty increased the bank’s loan growth forecast for the year to 12% to 14% from 11% to 12% earlier, mainly on optimism around double-digit loan demand in the RAM segment.“The enablers both from the fiscal side (GST cut) as well as RBI (rate cuts) will give sustained opportunity to grow in the RAM portfolio….We have seen an improvement in consumer demand particularly after the GST cuts especially in sectors like auto loans where we have gained market share…we will also growth our Xpress credit (personal loan) portfolio in double digits,” Setty said.SBI made a Rs 4,593 crore profit from the sale of a part of its stake sale in Yes Bank. In September the bank completed the divestment of a 13.18% stake in Yes Bank Limited to Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC).Net interest income (NII) increased 3% year on year, reflecting the pressure on the bank’s margins as deposit repricing still lagged loans. NII increased 3% to Rs 42,984 crore in the quarter ended September 2025.Net interest margin (NIM), or the difference between yield on advances and cost of deposits, fell to 2.97% in September 2025 from 3.14% a year ago mainly because yield on advances dropped to 8.68% from 8.93% a year ago after the cuts in policy rates.Quality of Advances Asset quality improved with net NPA falling to 0.42% from 0.53% a year ago.The bank continues to hold about 10% stake in Yes Bank, which was bailed out through central bank interventions in 2020.Setty said more than the 14% rate of return the bank made from the stake sale, SBI played a key role in the restructuring plan initiated in 2020, finally drawing a strategic partner for the lender.The quarter marked another milestone for India’s largest bank with total assets and deposits crossing the Rs 100 lakh crore mark. Setty said the bank has set its sights on becoming bigger.“If we want to become a top 10 among global banks in assets, we still have a long way to go. We have consistently maintained our total business at 20% of GDP and we aim to increase it to 25% of GDP,” Setty said.Corporate advances increased 7% year on year, but the bank is confident that growth in this segment will pick up because of the strong pipeline of loans. Managing director in charge of corporate banking Ashwini Tewari said the bank has a pipeline of more than Rs 7 lakh crore of corporate loans at different stages of sanctions and disbursements which also improve credit demand for the rest of the fiscal.Chairman Setty said the bank is open to collaborating with other banks for M\u0026A financing. “We know the corporates, we have always been doing outbound deals. We do not mind collaborating with others,” he said.M\u0026A financing will be part of corporate banking, but Setty said the bank would develop a strategy only after final guidelines are issued by the central bank.",

Mahindra \u0026 Mahindra rose 1.70 per cent to ₹3,642, and Adani Ports advanced 1.36 per cent to ₹1,464.10. On the losing side, Hindalco led the decliners with a sharp drop of 6.15 per cent to ₹780.30 from ₹831.40. Grasim Industries fell 4.37 per cent to ₹2,756.10, while Power Grid Corporation declined 2.38 per cent to ₹272.40. Adani Enterprises slipped 1.41 per cent to ₹2,385.70, and Max Healthcare shed 1.19 per cent to ₹1,124.80. “The Nifty 50 opened on a steady note near 25,615 after two sessions of range-bound movement, managing to hold just above its key support at 25,575,” said Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money. “The broader mood remains cautious, with investors treading carefully amid mixed global cues, persistent FII outflows, and a packed earnings calendar that continues to guide near-term sentiment.” Institutional flows remained a concern, with FIIs offloading equities worth ₹1,883 crore on November 4, marking their fourth consecutive session of selling. However, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) provided support by purchasing equities worth over ₹3,500 crore for the eighth straight session. “For the near-term, the resumption of sustained selling by FIIs (₹15,336 crores in the last five days) and increasing FII short positions will weigh on markets,” said Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. “In the coming days the focus of the market will be the developments in the US Supreme Court which is hearing the petition against Trump tariffs.” Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, noted that Thursday’s trade could see a rebound with optimism surrounding ongoing India-US trade negotiations. “Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal noted that talks on the proposed Bilateral Trade Agreement are progressing, though key issues remain,” he said. Technical analysts pointed to key resistance and support levels that could determine near-term direction. “The Nifty 50 slipped just below its key support at 25,660—a zone that has consistently seen buying interest in recent sessions,” said Ponmudi R. “For sentiment to turn constructive, the index needs to reclaim and hold above 25,720 on an hourly close, which could trigger short covering and pave the way for a rebound toward 25,850–26,000.” Amruta Shinde, Technical \u0026 Derivative Analyst at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited, advised caution. “Traders are advised to maintain a cautious buy-on-dips strategy, particularly when using leverage,” she said. “Fresh long positions should be considered only if the Nifty sustains above the 26,100 level.” In commodities, gold found support from safe-haven buying amid political uncertainty in the United States, while crude oil remained under pressure below $60 per barrel due to rising inventories.

Robust credit growth, driven by strong retail spending during the festive season, enabled the country’s largest lender by assets to outperform Street estimates.\n\nThe milestone coincides with SBI surpassing the ₹100 trillion total business mark, comprising advances of ₹44.20 lakh crore and deposits of ₹55.92 lakh crore as of September 2025.\n\nIn market-cap rankings, Reliance Industries leads with a valuation of $228 billion, followed by HDFC Bank at $170 billion. Bharti Airtel, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and ICICI Bank are the other corporates valued above $100 billion.\nNotably, three of the six companies in this elite group are banks, underscoring the sector’s growing dominance in the world’s fourth-largest economy.\n\nInfosys, which had crossed the $100 billion market-cap milestone in September 2021, currently commands a valuation of around $70 billion. The decline reflects persistent weakness in IT stocks and the continued depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar, both of which have weighed on sector valuations.\n\nMeanwhile, SBI Chairman CS Setty observed that the consolidation of public sector banks has clearly benefited the industry. The number of PSBs has fallen from 26 to 12, leading to significant scale advantages.\n\n“Scale is crucial, especially in the context of technology adoption. Without sufficient scale, investments in technology are difficult to justify, and achieving returns on such investments becomes challenging,” Setty told CNBC-TV18.\n\nHe added that there could be further consolidation within the sector, although he did not specify a timeline.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 2025, SBI reported a 3% year-on-year increase in net interest income (NII) to ₹42,985 crore, above the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of ₹40,766 crore.\n\nThe bank’s net profit for the quarter stood at ₹20,160 crore, up 10% year-on-year, also surpassing Street expectations of ₹17,048 crore. SBI’s results were further bolstered by a one-off gain of ₹4,593 crore from the sale of its stake in Yes Bank during the quarter.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, SBI shares have rallied more than 20%, outperforming the Nifty50’s gain of under 9% and the Nifty Bank index’s 14% rise.\n\nThe sharp upmove has also stretched the stock’s valuation, with SBI now trading at 1.5 times its 12-month forward book value, compared with its five-year average of 1.4 times.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data, 41 of the 50 analysts tracking the stock maintain a “Buy” rating, eight recommend “Hold,” and only one suggests “Sell.(Edited by : Vivek Dubey)",
